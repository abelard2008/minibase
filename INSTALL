  You need to have gnuMake, and g++ 2.7.2 to properly build
  and install Minibase.

      
  1) Set the environment variables 'MINIBASE_ROOT' to the top of
     the installed source tree.  The variable 'PLATFORM' should be
     set to the platform name as determined by the "sysname" script.

     In csh, this is done with:

     setenv MINIBASE_ROOT <the top level directory>

     setenv PLATFORM `$MINIBASE_ROOT/bin/sysname`


  2) Modify CONFIG to set a few include directories and compilers.

     Internal Release:
     2b) Unpack the proper version of 'tclpack.tar' for your m/c.

  3) type 'make'


  4) Users of minibase will need to:
       Add $MINIBASE_ROOT/bin to your search path, and add the
       definitions of MINIBASE_ROOT and PLATFORM to your
       startup (.cshrc) file.
