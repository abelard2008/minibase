<H1>Choice of Topics in ``Database Management Systems''</H1>

The main pedagogical objective of this book is to
provide clear and thorough discussions of the topics covered,
while limiting the number of topics to maintain focus
on fundamental issues.
Throughout, a quantitative approach is used with detailed examples.
<I> An important feature of the book is the extensive set of
exercises, with a strong emphasis on problem-solving. </I>
The choice of material has been influenced by these considerations: 
<P>
(1)  To concentrate on issues central to the <I>design, tuning and implementation
of relational database applications</I>.  Many of the issues discussed
(e.g., buffering and access methods) are not specific to relational
systems, but in general, I have concentrated on relational systems.
<P>
(2)  To provide adequate coverage of implementation topics to support a
concurrent laboratory section or course project.  For example, implementation of
relational operations has been covered in more detail than is
necessary in a first course.  However, the variety of alternative
implementation techniques allows for a wide choice of project
assignments:  an instructor who wishes to assign
implementation of Sort-Merge Join might cover that topic in depth, whereas
another might choose to emphasize Index Nested Loops Join.

<H1>Chapter Organization</H1>

The material can be divided into roughly six parts, as indicated in 
the figure, which also shows the dependencies between chapters.
An arrow from Chapter A to Chapter B means that A depends on
material in B.  The broken arrows indicate a weak dependency, which can
be ignored at the instructor's discretion.  
The first two chapters cover material that is basic to the rest of the book,
and we assume that they are covered first.
Each of the remaining five parts is described below, along with its dependence,
if any, on the other four parts.

<P>
<B>1. Part A:  Query Languages</B>  Relational
algebra and calculus, QBE and SQL.  It is worth noting that the coverage
of SQL, following the SQL-92 standard,
is quite extensive; in addition to the data retrieval features of SQL, many
important concepts, such as authorization, views and referential
integrity, are discussed in the context of SQL.
<P>
<B>2. Part B:  File Organizations</B>  File organizations and indexes.
This part depends only on Chapter 3, and this is only
to the extent that implementing a file organization requires an
understanding of file and record formats.
<P>
<B>3. Part C:  Query Optimization and Evaluation</B>  Disks, buffer management, 
implementation of relational operators and generation of query plans.  
An understanding of sorting techniques is useful but not essential;
sorting can be treated as a basic operation in the discussion of
relational operator implementations.
<P>
<B>4. Part D:  Database Design</B>  Conceptual design,
normalization, physical design and performance tuning.
The discussion of how to translate an ER diagram into
a collection of SQL table definitions assumes an understanding of the integrity
constraint features of SQL-92.  A basic knowledge of views is useful
in discussing conceptual database design.  Other than this, the chapter on
the ER model
is independent of Part A.  The discussion of physical design and tuning
assumes a good understanding of query optimization, and in particular,
of the use of indexes.
<P>
<B>5. Part E:  Advanced Topics</B>  Concurrency control and recovery are covered with
an emphasis on locking and logging techniques.
The discussion of concurrency control in tree indexes depends upon a knowledge
of tree indexes, and the discussion of query optimization in parallel and
distributed databases assumes an understanding of query optimization in
a centralized DBMS.  In general, the chapters in Part E should be covered
after material from the other parts has been covered.
Chapters on Object Databases, Rule-Based Extensions to Relational Databases and
Additional Topics are not included in this beta edition, but
will be there in the first regular edition.
<P>
In an important sense, the first three parts of the book lead up 
to the material on
database design and tuning.  I discuss these topics
from a very practical perspective, with several examples.  A reader who
studies this material carefully will quickly realize that a thorough 
understanding of several basic issues is essential for good design.
The goal is to ensure that the earlier chapters provide the reader with the
necessary foundation.

<H1>Order of Presentation</H1>

The material in the text is presented in the order that I usually cover
it, and is influenced by the order of the accompanying
programming assignments, and by my preference for covering all
database design topics together <I>after</I> covering all optimization
related material.  It is likely that other instructors will want to
cover some topics in a different order, based on the needs of their
courses.  For example, some instructors will want to cover SQL,
and perhaps get students to use a relational database,
before discussing file organizations or indexing.
In a course that emphasizes database design, many of the 
implementation-oriented chapters might well be skipped altogether.
The book has therefore been designed to be flexible with respect to the
ordering of material, and inter-chapter dependencies have been kept to
a minimum.  In particular, Parts A through D, regarded as units,
can be covered in pretty much any order, although it is probably a
good idea to cover Part B before part C, and to cover Part B before
discussing physical design and tuning.  The remaining inter-part dependencies are minor.
<P>
Some additional points to note:
<P>
Several section headings contain an asterisk.  This does not necessarily
indicate a higher level of difficulty.  Rather, omitting all asterisked
sections leaves about the right amount of material in Chapters 1 through 19 
for a broad introductory
one-quarter or one-semester course (depending on the
depth at which the remaining material is discussed and the nature of
the course assignments).
<P>
It is not necessary to cover all the alternatives for a given operator
in order to cover query optimization adequately.
<P>
The material on SQL queries can be taught without first covering relational algebra and calculus.
This may be desirable if an instructor wishes to assign SQL assignments
early.  However, an understanding of algebra and calculus will enable students
to appreciate the foundations of SQL.
Similarly, QBE can be taught without a prior discussion of DRC, but briefly covering
DRC first is recommended.
<P>
An instructor who wishes to cover the ER model before SQL can do so
by deferring a discussion of ER diagram to SQL table translation.
Indeed, the ER model can be covered before the relational model
by exercising some care in the discussion
of integrity constraints.
<P>
The book contains more material than can be  
covered in a one semester course.  
It can be used in several kinds of introductory or second
courses by choosing topics appropriately,  
or in a two-course sequence by supplementing the material with some
advanced readings in the second course.
