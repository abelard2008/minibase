Here's a better version of the help file for the Session window:

dbnorm Help: Session Window
============================

dbnorm provides you with full display and editing capabilities for all
decompositions specified in the process of schema refinement.  Each
source relation in your database can have one or more decomposition
sessions associated with it, and within a session the source relation
can be decomposed into new, "derived" relations.  The derived
relations can be decomposed further within the same session, or new
sessions can be created for derived relations.

IMPORTANT: Any time you try to create a derived relation that has an
attribute set identical to a relation that already exists, dbnorm will
ask you to make a choice about how the new relation should be
created. You can either create a brand new relation with the same
attribute set as the other relation, but with a separate identity--any
sessions associated with the old relation will not be associated with
the new one. The other option is to use the previously existing
relation in the decomposition that is currently being created. This
will bring the name and associated sessions of the old relation into
the session you are currently working on.

Whenever a relation (source or derived) has more than one session, one
of the sessions is chosen to be the "default" session.  The default
session is always the session at the top of any list of sessions, and
it is the default session that gets used in the process of displaying
all base relations.

When you select a source relation in the main window, a list of its
decomposition session appears.  You can view one of these sessions by
double-clicking on the session name or selecting "View Session" from
the Session menu.  You can also start a new session by selecting "New
Session" from the Session menu.  Once you have displayed a session,
the menus in the session window allow you to perform these operations:

	* Save or rename the session.
	* Test a relation for BCNF/3NF.
	* Automatically decompose a relation into BCNF or 3NF.
	* Start a new decomposition session for a relation.
	* Link a relation to another session.
	* Undo decompositions within the session.
	* Hide or unhide attribute lists in the session tree.


Here is a description of how to perform each of these operations:

NOTE: If you click on a relation name in the session window, that
relation becomes the active relation in the session.  You then have
the ability to perform various operations on the active relation
through the operations in the Relation menu.

* Save or rename the session.

	Select Save from the File menu to create a permanent copy of
	the current session.  Select "Save As" to make a copy of the
	session under a different name.

	NOTE: "Save As" makes a copy of the session, the copy with the
	old name is not deleted.

* Test a relation for BCNF/3NF.

	After highlighting a relation, you can test the relation for
	BCNF and 3NF through the "Test/Decompose" option in the
	Relation menu.  If violations exist, you will be presented
	with a list of the violations, and you can respond in one of
	three ways:

	   1. Do nothing.

	       Just click on the Dismiss button.

	   2. Decompose to remove a violation.

	       Select a violation from the list, then click on the
	       Decompose button.  You will be warned if the generated
	       decomposition is not dependency preserving or is not a
	       lossless join decomposition.  If a warning is
	       displayed, you can cancel the decomposition by clicking
	       on the Cancel button.  Otherwise, the decomposition is
	       performed and the derived relations are displayed in
	       the session window.

	   3. Perform a custom decomposition.

	       If you click on the "Custom Decomposition" button, a
	       window will appear in which you can define a new
	       decomposition for the active relation.  At the top of
	       the decomposition window is a list of all attributes in
	       the original relation.  And across the bottom half of
	       the window is a set of frames which will display the
	       attribute sets for all relations in the decomposition.
	       I'll refer to the original relation as the "parent"
	       relation, and all derived relations as "children".

	       To copy attributes to a child relation, first go to the
	       parent's attribute list and highlight the attributes to
	       be copied.  Then click on the Add button in the
	       appropriate child frame.  You can also delete
	       attributes from a child by highlighting part of the
	       child's attribute list and clicking on the Delete
	       button.

	       If you want to add a child frame, select "Add Child"
	       from the Decompose menu.  To delete a frame, click
	       somewhere in the frame (the frame border will become a
	       thick, solid black outline), and then select "Delete
	       Child" from the Decompose menu.

	       You can generate a BCNF or 3NF decomposition by
	       selecting "Generate BCNF" or "Generate 3NF" from the
	       Decomposition menu.  And at any time while working on
	       your decomposition, you can test for Lossless Join and
	       Dependency Preservation through the Test menu.

	       Once you are satisfied with your decomposition, click
	       on the Done button and the decomposition will be added
	       to the session.  Clicking on the Cancel button discards
	       all work you have done in the decomposition window.

* Automatically decompose a relation into BCNF or 3NF.

	Another option under the "Test/Decompose" item of the Relation
	menu is to automatically generate a decompostion that puts
	your relation into a chosen normal form (BCNF or 3NF).  If the
	relation in already in the chosen normal form, you will be
	informed of this and no decomposition will be performed.

* Start a new decomposition session for a relation.

  	Select "New Session" from the Relation menu to open a new
	session window for the active relation.

* Link a relation to another session.

	Within a specific session, you can create a link between one
	of the relations in that session and some other session which
	has that relation as its root. If you select "Link to Another
	Session" from the Relation menu you will be shown a list of
	other decompositions defined for the highlighted
	relation. Selecting one of these other sessions establishes it
	as the "linked session" for the highlighted relation. These
	session links are followed when you ask dbnorm to generate SQL
	statements for all base relations in your database. Once a
	linked session has been defined for a relation, its name will
	appear in the linked session button below the session
	tree. Clicking on this button will bring up a session window
	for the linked session. If you have not defined a linked
	session for the relation that is highlighted in the session
	window, then no text will appear in the linked session button,
	and clicking on the button has no effect.

* Undo decompositions within the session.

	Once a relation has been decomposed within a given session,
	you can delete all of the derived relations below the active
	relation by selecting "Undo Decomposition" from the Relation
	menu.

	WARNING: Deleting a derived relation which has decomposition
	sessions associated with it results in all the sessions being
	deleted also.

* Hide or unhide attribute lists in the session tree.

	Within the session tree you have the ability to hide and
	unhide the attribute list of any relation.  By double-clicking
	on a relation name you toggle the relation between hiding and
	displaying its attribute lists.  Options also exist in the
	View menu for performing hide/unhide operations over the
	entire tree.
