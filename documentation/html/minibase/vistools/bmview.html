<H1>Buffer Manager Viewer</H1>

<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<P>
This visualization tool is intended to help understand the Buffer Manager.
It is executed against a previously generated trace, and can be
run independently of Minibase proper.  The number of buffer frames
can be set, and the contents of the buffer pool are displayed, along
with relevant information such as pin counts and dirty status.
Statisics such as the hit ratio are also shown.
Interesting exercises include running traces that reflect different
replacement policies and access patterns, and devising traces that
illustrate interesting situations (e.g., sequential flooding of
the buffer pool).
<P>
The tool can be executed using the command <b>bmview</b>.
Examples are included in the directory <i>programs/vistools/bmtool/exercises</i>.
