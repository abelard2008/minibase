Run this program with a color monitor
-------------------------------------

  This program shows columns that have errors or inconsistencies by
coloring their labels (blue for an inconsistency, red for an error).
These don't show up on a black-and-white monitor.


The deal with the asterisks
---------------------------

  When you type into a column, you will notice that its label gets an
asterisk (*) after it.  This is just a visual cue that you have
changed this column.  You can cancel these changes by hitting the
Escape key.  You can get the system to accept the changes by hitting
Return (or Enter), or by tabbing or clicking to another column.


`Inconsistencies' vs `errors'
-----------------------------

  An `error,' which is shown with a red label, means you must go edit
that column before you will be able to generate SQL for the query.

  An `inconsistency,' shown with a blue label, means that something
about this column is inconsistent in the current context of the rest
of the query---for example, a condition that refers to an example
element that is not currently defined.  You might have misspelled that
example element, or you might not have defined it yet.  If you define
it somewhere else, the inconsistency is resolved, and the label is
returned to normal.
