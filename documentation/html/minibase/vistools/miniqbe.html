<H1>A QBE-style Query Interface</H1>

<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<P>
This interface supports quite a large subset of QBE queries,
the main restriction being that no table skeleton can contain
more than one row.  In addition, no update commands are supported,
and little if any type checking is done!
However, aggregate operations, calculated columns, condition boxes,
negation and complex selections are all supported.
Queries are translated into SQL-92.
<P>
The QBE interface is not integrated with the Minibase front-end.
It can be run using the command <b>miniqbe</b>, and the resulting
SQL queries can be cut and pasted (using X windows) into the
SQL query input box in the main front-end.  However, the user
should note that the QBE front-end can produce queries that
may not be handled by Minibase.
