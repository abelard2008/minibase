<H1>B+ Tree Viewer</H1>

<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<P>
This visualization tool is intended to help understand B+ Tree
search, insertion and deletion algorithms.
As operations are carried out, the main window shows the structure of
the tree, and an auxiliary window shows the nodes affected by the
current operation.  The contents of any node can be seen by clicking
on the node.  The tool can be run against a previously
generated trace of B+ Tree operations, stepping through the trace
one or more steps at a time or upto a preset breakpoint, or with
interactive insertions and deletions.
<P>
The tool can be executed using the command <b>btview</b>.
Examples are included in the directory <i>programs/vistools/bttool/exercises</i>.

<H2>Design Decisions</H2>

The tool essentially maintains the visual state of the tree; the
actual tree is maintained by executing Minibase in the background.
When the contents of a node are desired, for instance, they are
obtained by issuing a call to Minibase.
