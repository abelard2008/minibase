<H1>Normalization Tool</H1>

<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<P>
This tool supports normalization based on functional dependencies.
Schemas can be created, FDs specified, and the schemas then
tested for various properties (e.g., find a minimal cover, find keys,
check if they are in a particular normal form and find FDs that
cause a violation if not, etc.) and decomposed further.
Properties of decompositions (lossless-join and dependency-preservation)
can be checked easily.
<P>
Importantly, the tool supports a concept of a <i>refinement session</i>,
in which a schema is decomposed repeatedly and the resulting
decomposition tree is then saved.  For a given schema, a user might
consider several alternative decompositions (more precisely,
decomposition trees), and each of these can be saved as a refinement
session.  This provides a very flexible and convenient mechanism for
trying out several alternative decomposition strategies.
<P>
A complementary tool to create and edit ER diagrams and to produce
a relational schema with FDs and inclusion dependencies from such
diagrams is nder development.
The normalization tool can also generate SQL-92 statements to create tables
(with appropriate primary key and referential integrity constraints)
corresponding to a set of schemas, FDs and (restricted) inclusion dependencies.
<P>
Together these two tools should support the paradigm of developing
an ER diagram and then refining it using normalization.  The goal is
to enable a user to focus on the important issue of how to choose between
alternatives in database design, rather than on the details of
normalization algorithms.
<P>
The tool can be run using the command <b>designview</b>.
Examples are included in the directory <i>programs/dbnorm/examples</i>.
