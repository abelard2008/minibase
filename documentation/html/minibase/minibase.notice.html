<strong> Minibase (c) Copyright R. Ramakrishnan,

 University of Wisconsin at Madison, 1996, All Rights Reserved.
 Version 0.0
</strong>
<P>

Version 0.0 of Minibase is being released in order to let early users
to try it out quickly.  Version 1.0 will be released by September 10, 1996,
and will differ primarily in being tested further and having more
uptodate documentation.  These early versions of Minibase are appropriate
for course projects in which components are to be written based on the
header files, but the quality of code across the various components is
uneven.  We hope to improve upon this in Version 2.0, which will also
include the multi-user components, and will be available by Spring 1997.
