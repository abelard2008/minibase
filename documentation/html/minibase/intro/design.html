The figure above describes the Minibase modules.
<P>
The Minibase server instantiates the shared memory area. This shared
memory area contains the buffer pool, lock table, transaction table
and the log tail. Varying levels of granularity exist for access to
the shared components. Semaphores ( acting as latches ) ensure
consistency. On startup, the server executes a  restart operation 
initially, to ensure that the system is a consistent state. The server
keeps track of the number of clients in the system and needs to be
explicitly shut down. At server shutdown, the buffer pool is flushed
to disk, all semaphores and shared memory is destroyed and the database
is left in a consistent state.

<P>
Every client attaches itself to the shared memory region .i.e. it
obtains pointers to the objects in shared memory. The client also
instantiates pointers to other global objects which operate in its
own space: for example, pointers to the DB object, catalogs, recovery
manager and the lock manager.

<P>
The <a href="single_user.html"> Query Evaluation </a>
path is identical in both single and multi user versions except
that in the multi user version, log records are written before any
updates to disk, latches and locking is used to maintain the consistency
of the database. During the <b> normal mode </b> of operation, the
RDBMS system merely executes queries from the user.
The RDBMS system functions in the <b> recovery mode</b> when the
system is restarted after a crash.
