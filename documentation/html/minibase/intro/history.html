<H1>Minibase History</H1>

<P>

Many years ago, David Dewitt developed a database course project
that involved building a small relational DBMS called Minirel in C.
It has inspired several revised versions, and these have been
used at Wisconsin and elsewhere over the years.

<P>
Mike Carey and Raghu Ramakrishnan wanted to develop a more complete
version of Minirel, in C++, including components for concurrency control and
recovery, more relational operator evaluation methods, a query
optimizer, and design tools.  The result is Minibase.  Minirel supported 
a course project in which students developed parts of the code;  Minibase
additionally supports exercises in which various components are
studied through experiments.  The system design differs
in many ways from earlier versions, and it is a more
comprehensive system than Minirel, but hopefully, the spirit of the original
design, encouraging a hands-on approach to databases, is retained.

<P>
Much of the new Minibase was developed as a graduate course 
project by students taking CS764.  Different groups developed 
different parts such as the disk space and heap file managers 
(Ravi Murthy and Sriram Narasimhan), the buffer manager (Kan Qiu 
and Fei Su), B+ trees (Yanming Cao and Celena Tanguay), linear 
hashing (Weiqing Huang), log manager (Cjin Lee and Ajitkumar 
Natarajan), lock manager (Francis Salmon and Gary Zipfel), recovery 
manager (Ranjani Ramamurthy and Arthur Tsoi), join methods 
(Raghu Mallena and Amit Shukla) and query plan interpreter (Donko Donjerkovic). 
Peter Feakins and Bill Kimmel were responsible for integrating the various 
components for the single user minibase. 
<p>
The project was coordinated by Mike Carey and Raghu Ramakrishnan.
Some code (e.g., parts of the buffer manager and heap files) was based on a
C++ version of Minirel developed by Dewitt and Jussi Myllymaki, but most of
it was written afresh.

<P>
The code developed in CS764
was significantly refined and extended, and
several additional tools were designed and developed, through the efforts
of many people under the direction of Ramakrishnan.
Huseyin Bektas and Harry Stavropoulos developed visualization
tools for the buffer manager and B+ trees, and this code was
developed further by Weiqing Huang.  Stephen Harris and Michael Lee
developed an SQL query optimizer and a visual plan explanation tool.  Donko Donjerkovic
developed the query optimizer further.  Bill Kimmel and Luke Blanshard 
continued the integration effort and considerably cleaned up the single-user
version.  Ranjani Ramamurthy substantially reworked many of the multi-user 
components and integrated them to produce the multi-user version of Minibase.
Eben Haber used the Opossum schema manager 
to develop a tool for drawing and maintaining ER diagrams.  Andy Therber 
and Andrew Prock developed an ER diagram to relational tables translator and a 
Tcl/Tk based database design tool that supports normalization.
Also, Emmanuel Ackaouy, Lee Schumacher and Bryan So made significant 
contributions to an earlier version of Minibase.  This code from this 
version did not survive, but it influenced the design
of the current Minibase.  
Shawn Flisakowski, Krishna Kunchithapadam and Venkatesh Ganti contributed
to the testing and development of early releases of this software.

<P>
Needless to say, Minibase would not have been
possible without the dedicated efforts of the many students involved.
