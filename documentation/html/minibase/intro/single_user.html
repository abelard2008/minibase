<P>

It is easiest to understand Minibase in terms of how a query is processed.
A query is first parsed and optimized to obtain an evaluation plan.
The evaluation plan is structured as a tree of iterators, each of which
supports a ``get-next-tuple'' interface, and corresponds typically to
a relational algebra operator.  Execution is initiated by
calling get-next-tuple at the root of the plan tree, which successively
generates get-next-tuple calls on descendant nodes.  
Execution consists essentially of 
a data-driven loop of such calls until all the
input tuples have been processed.  This is described below in more detail.
(Only single-user Minibase is covered in this overview.)

<A HREF="../planner/query.html"><B>Parser and Optimizer:</B></A>  These 
modules take an SQL query and find the best plan for evaluating it.
The optimizer is similar to the one used in System R (and subsequently 
in most commercial relational database systems).  In optimizing
a query, the optimizer considers information in the catalog about
relations and indexes.  It can read catalog information from a Unix file, 
and thus the parser/optimizer can be used in a stand-alone mode, independent of
the rest of Minibase (say, for optimizer related exercises).
<P>

<A HREF="../planner/planner.html"><B>Execution Planner:</B></A> This 
module takes the plan tree produced by the optimizer, and creates
a run-time data structure.  This structure is essentially a
tree of ``iterators'', each of which supports a ``get-next-tuple''
interface.  Tuples are returned in response to get-next-tuple calls
by copying them into dynamically allocated main memory (not the buffer pool).
<P>
The figure below shows details of iterator trees and the Minibase
code that they call.

<B>Main loop:</B></A> Execution is 
triggered by ``pulling'' on the root of
the tree with a get-next-tuple call.
This results in similar calls to iterators lower in the tree.
Leaf level iterators retrieve tuples from a relation (perhaps
using an index), and intermediate level iterators in the tree
correspond to joins.  Selections and projections are ``piggy-backed''
onto these iterators.
More information is available on each of these components:
<P>
<A HREF="../planner/iterator.html"><B>Iterators</B></A>  
A ``get-next-tuple'' interface for file scans, index scans and joins.
<P>
<A HREF="../joins/joins.html"><B>Join Methods</B></A>  Nested loops,
sort-merge and hash joins are supported.
<P>
<A HREF="../spaceMgr/heap_file.html"><B>Heap Files</B></A>  All data
records are stored in heap files, which are files of unordered pages
implemented on top of the DB class.
<P>
<A HREF="../AM/am.html"><B>Access Methods:</B></A> Currently two
types of access methods are supported, <A HREF="../BTree/BTree.html">
<B>B+ Trees</B></A> and <A HREF="../linearHash/linearHash.html"><B>
Linear Hashing</B></A>.  
The access methods in Minibase are dense, unclustered, and
store key/rid-of-data-record pairs (Alternative 2, in terms of the 
<A HREF="../dbbook.html"><B>text</B></A>).
Data records are always stored in heap files, as noted above,
and access methods are implemented (like heap files) as 
files on top of the DB class.
<P>
<A HREF="../bufMgr/bufMgr.html"><B>Buffer Manager:</B></A> 
The buffer manager swaps pages in and out of the (main memory) buffer
pool in response to requests from access method and heap file
code.
<P>
<A HREF="../spaceMgr/dsm.html"><B>Disk Space Manager:</B></A> 
A database is a fixed size Unix file, and pages (in the file) on
disk are managed by the disk space manager.
