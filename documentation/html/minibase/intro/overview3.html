<H1>Overview Of Query Evaluation</H1>

<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<P>
We conclude our overview by tracing a query's journey through Minibase.
<P>

<H2>Top Level</H2>
The user starts Minibase, providing the database name as an
option, along with the size of the database and buffer pool
(in pages).  The 
disk space manager is instantiated and the buffer manager is 
instantiated.  The user then enters the SQL query.  The 
<B><A HREF="../parser/parser.html">parser</B></A> checks the
syntactic validity of the query and does the necessary type
checking.  A call to the 
<B><A HREF="../system/Catalog/catalog.html">catalog</A></B>
is needed at this point.  The plan tree is passed to the  
<B><A HREF="../optimizer/optimizer.html>optimizer</B></A> which
calls the <B><A HREF="../system/Catalog/catalog.html">catalog</A></B>
 to get the cardinality information.  The best plan is computed
and the top node of the tree is passed to the 
<B><A HREF="../planner/planner.html">planner</B></A>.  The planner
recursively creates various <A HREF="../planner/iterator.html><B>iterators</B></A> 
(such as scans and joins) 
that will actually access the pages of the database.  Iterators
return tuples when <B>get_next</B> is called on them.
<P>
Consider this query:
<BR>
<B>
<P>
select sailors.sname<BR>
from sailors, reserves<BR>
where sailors.sid = reserves.sid;<BR></B>
<P>
A sample plan tree is shown below. 
The join takes two scans on two different
relations as its input.  The join will call get_next on each
of the scan iterators as tuples are needed.  Filescans are used because
we assume that no matching indexes exist, in this example.

<H2>Record Storage and Retrieval</H2>
In the sample query shown above,
the join will also perform a projection, retaining only the sname attribute.
For every call to get_next of the outer tuple, the entire
inner relation is scanned.  If the tuples match, then the
projection operation is performed.
<P>
To scan a relation, the heap file must be opened.  Once opened,
a scan object is created.  Calls to get_next on the scan object
result in calls to the buffer manager to pin pages in the buffer pool.  
The page in the buffer pool is raw data cast as type HFPage.  The 
scan object calls methods of HFPage
to find out where the next record is, and returns a pointer to this
record.

<H2>Conclusion</H2>
Tuples are printed to the screen after each successive call
to nested_loops_join::getNext.
<P>
The top level call to the nested_loops_join ends when DONE
is returned.  At this point, the destructor of nested_loops_join
is called, causing its inputs (the two file scans) to be deleted.
