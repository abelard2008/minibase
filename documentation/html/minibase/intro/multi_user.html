The components that are specific to a multi-user system are the
concurrency control modules. These include the 
<A HREF="../os/transaction.html">transaction manager,</A>
<A HREF="../lockMgr/lockMgr.html">lock manager,</A>
<A HREF="../recoveryMgr/recoveryMgr.html">recovery manager</A> and
<A HREF="../logMgr/logMgr.html">log manager.</A>
In addition to these four
modules, operating system support is required. This can be
provided by a client-server protocol, or as in the case of
Minibase, a 
<A HREF="../os/os.html">shared memory</A>
system.

<P>
In conventional multi-user client-server RDBMS systems, 
the server is a heavy 
process which performs all operations related to concurrency control.
The client is a lightweight process which merely obtains the SQL
input from the user and communicates this to a server (possibly
through sockets or some other communication mechanism). 
Minibase works on a shared memory model. The server 
instantiates shared memory structures and performs
periodic deadlock resolution and dead process detection.
The clients are not lightweight, in that they perform many of the
tasks associated with concurrency.
This design was adopted largely to make the development of
multi-user Minibase from single-user Minibase as straightforward
as possible.
<P>
In multi-user Minibase, every process is a transaction. The
Minibase server is process 0 and clients are numbered from 1 onwards.
Thus the words <i>transaction</i> and <i>process</i> 
mean the same thing in Minibase.
<P>

<H2>The Server</H2> 
The Minibase server instantiates the shared memory area. This shared
memory area contains the buffer pool, lock table, transaction table
and the log tail. Varying levels of granularity exist for access to
the shared components. Semaphores ( acting as latches ) ensure
consistency. On startup, the server executes a  restart operation 
initially, to ensure that the system is a consistent state. 
It maintains information of the clients in the system : the transaction
ids, process ids and a flag to indicate validity of the transaction.
The validity flag is required as the server performs the all-important
task of deadlock detection. 
<p>
After performing the restart operation, the server does three tasks in
a loop. <p>
<UL>
<LI> Checks for defunct transactions and invalidates them. <br>
<LI> Checks for deadlock, and on finding a cycle picks a transaction for
eviction and invalidates its entry in the transaction table.<br>
<LI> Sleeps for a period of time ( say 20 seconds) and goes back to step 1.<br>
</UL>
<p>
Step 1 is required to take care of those processes that die
but do not clean up on exit --- for example a transaction  that has been 
killed by a 'ctrl-c'. These processes may still hold locks on resources
and may be using shared memory and so, need to be aborted.
<p>
Deadlock detection and resolution is performed in the following manner.
The server checks for deadlocks and picks a victim on finding a cycle. The
victim's <i>valid</i> field is invalidated. Invalidation is equivalent to
forcing the process to abort. The server then wakes up the victim process.
Code in the 
<a HREF="../lockMgr/lockMgr.html"> Lock Manager</a>
ensures that a process always checks for its
status after returning from a lock operation. The process will proceed 
after a request for a lock only if it is still a valid transaction.
<p>
The server
keeps track of the number of clients in the system and needs to be
explicitly shut down. At server shutdown, the buffer pool is flushed
to disk, all semaphores and shared memory is destroyed and the database
is left in a consistent state.
<P>

<H2>The Client</H2> 

Every client attaches itself to the shared memory region .i.e. it
obtains pointers to the objects in shared memory. The client also
instantiates pointers to other global objects which operate in its
own space: for example, pointers to the DB object, catalogs, recovery
manager and the lock manager. When it exits, its entry is removed
from the transaction table by the minibase server.
<P>
The <a href="single_user.html"> query evaluation </a>
path is the same in both single- and multi-user versions except
that in the multi-user version, 
latches and locking are used to maintain the consistency
of the database. 
Log records are written before any updates to disk, 
and locking is used on write operations, in accordance with Strict 2PL.
