<H2>Introduction</H2>
The parser takes SQL queries and creates a tree that is then
optimized and executed by the Minibase planner.  
<P>
Ideally, type checking of attributes / relations should be done
here, but since the catalog structure was changing while this was
developed, type checking is done in the optimizer.

<H3>Bugs in the Parser</H3>
<UL>
 <LI>Inserts and Deletes are not supported through the parser
<! <LI>It can't handle:  VAL op attrName. However, it can do this=> attrName op VAL>
</UL>
