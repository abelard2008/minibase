We have done extensive testing during the developement of our code.
In this section we presents couple of typical queries that ilustrate
most of challinges the interpreter has to deal with.
Catalog shema that we are using is this one:
<PRE>
relation dept(dname: string(50), dno: int);
relation emp(jno: int, dno: int, ename: string(50), empid:int);
relation job(jname: string(50), jno: int);
</PRE>

Our first example is the very simple join.
Using the following query as a test:
<PRE>
select emp.ename, dept.dname
from emp, dept
where emp.dno = dept.dno;
</PRE>
Optimizer will select the following plan:

<ul>
	<li> <a href = "q1.ps"> query1.ps </a>
</ul>

and the plan interpreter output is this:

<PRE>
FileScanIter 0x101ae0  called
  relName: dept
  types (2): string(50) int
  projects (2): {outer, 2} {outer, 1}
  selects:

FileScanIter 0x102ef0  called
  relName: emp
  types (4): int int string(50) int
  projects (2): {outer, 3} {outer, 2}
  selects:

sort_merge 0x102d38  called
  memory available: 100 pages
  resulting order: Ascending
  outer iterator 0x101ae0
  inner iterator 0x102ef0
  outer join column and field length: 1, 4
  inner join column and field length: 2, 4
  outer rel sorted: 0
  inner rel sorted: 0
  inner types (2): string(50) int
  outer types (2): int string(50)
  final projects (2): {inner, 1} {outer, 2}
  final selects:

get_next called on top iterator
Transaction commited
</PRE>

There were couple of things tested here. First, notice that the iterators
are correctly linked to each other (according to the plan picture).
This is indicated by printing "this" pointers upon any iterator invocation.
Also, notice how the fields offsets for the same attribute is changing
depending on the position in the tree.
<P>
For example, <tt>emp.ename</tt> had the offset 3 in the original relation and
that is how it is being referenced in the <tt>FileScan</tt> iterator.
On the other hand, in the final project in the <tt>sort_merge</tt> it
is referenced as field number 1.
<P>
Our next test is the 3-way join query:
<PRE>
select emp.ename, dept.dname, job.jname
from emp, dept, job
where emp.dno = dept.dno and emp.jno = job.jno;
</PRE>
Picture of the optimizer tree produced is given as query2.ps.
<ul>
<li> <a href = "query2.ps"> query2.ps </a>
</ul>

Here is the plan iterpreter output:

<PRE>

IndexScanIter 0x105de8  called
  index: B_Index
  relName: job
  indName: jjhash.index
  types (2): string(50) int 
  projects (2): {outer, 2} {outer, 1} 
  selects: 

nested_loops_join 0x1082e0  called
  memory available: 100 pages
  inner rel name: dept
  inner types (2): string(50) int 
  inner selects: 
  outer iterator 0x105de8
  outer types (2): int string(50) 
  final projects (4): {inner, 1} {inner, 2} {outer, 2} {outer, 1} 
  final selects: 

IndexScanIter 0x10a3a8  called
  index: B_Index
  relName: emp
  indName: ejnob.index
  types (4): int int string(50) int 
  projects (3): {outer, 3} {outer, 2} {outer, 1} 
  selects: 

sort_merge 0x107548  called
  memory available: 100 pages
  resulting order: Descending
  outer iterator 0x1082e0
  inner iterator 0x10a3a8
  outer join column and field length: 4, 4
  inner join column and field length: 3, 4
  outer rel sorted: 1
  inner rel sorted: 0
  inner types (3): string(50) int int 
  outer types (4): string(50) int string(50) int 
  final projects (3): {inner, 1} {outer, 3} {outer, 1} 
  final selects: 
	{inner, 2} = {outer, 2};

get_next called on top iterator
Transaction commited
</PRE>

This 3-way join illustrates how various types of iterators are called
appropriately. In the example we have invocation of <tt>sort_merge</tt>
and <tt> nested_loops_join </tt> joins and the <tt>B_tree</tt> indexed access
method. Also, notice that the interpreter has correctly identified 
whether inner or outer relations are sorted with respect to primary
join condition. It should be mentioned that the optimizer considers
tuples comming out of top iterator to be in random order in this case.
It is correct,
since the order is on <tt>job.jno</tt> and that attribute is missing
in the final projection. 

<p>
Our last example is the join that includes the single relation.
This complicated selection condition is designed to confuse the interpreter.
However, it's not easy to confuse this one.
Here is the query:
<PRE>
select A.ename, B.ename
from emp A, emp B
where A.dno = B.dno or (A.jno < A.empid and B.empid <> A.empid);
</PRE>

Here is the optimizer output:
<ul>
<li> <a href = "query3.ps"> query3.ps </a>
</ul>
And here is the plan interpreter output:

<PRE>

FileScanIter 0x10a0b0  called
  relName: emp
  types (4): int int string(50) int 
  projects (3): {outer, 4} {outer, 3} {outer, 2} 
  selects: 

nested_loops_join 0x10c4d8  called
  memory available: 100 pages
  inner rel name: emp
  inner types (4): int int string(50) int 
  inner selects: 
  outer iterator 0x10a0b0
  outer types (3): int string(50) int 
  final projects (2): {inner, 3} {outer, 2} 
  final selects: 
	{inner, 2} = {outer, 3}, {outer, 1} != {inner, 4};
	{inner, 2} = {outer, 3}, {inner, 1} < {inner, 4};

get_next called on top iterator
Transaction commited
</PRE>
Notice that the relation name of both relation <tt>A</tt> and 
<tt>B</tt> is correctly interpreted
as <tt>emp</tt>
<P>
For the end lets see how the planner will recover from the error.
We have the option to provoke the error by setting the environment
variable <tt>error</tt>:
<PRE>
setenv error set
</PRE>
Here is the interpreter output of the same query.

<PRE>

FileScanIter 0x10a0b0  called
  relName: emp
  types (4): int int string(50) int
  projects (3): {outer, 4} {outer, 3} {outer, 2}
  selects:

****************************************
Env var error = set; Error set on purpose
****************************************
First error occurred in the Error occurred: in the: Planner and was received by
Parser

Transaction aborted
</PRE>

Notice that the interpreter has aborted this transaction.
