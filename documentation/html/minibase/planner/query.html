<P>
A query in Minibase follows this path:
<UL>
 <LI>User enters query using SQL (or using the QBE front end; if QBE is used,
	the query is translated to SQL).
 <LI>The <A HREF="../parser/parser.html"><B>parser</B></A> reads the SQL query 
	and checks for syntactic validity.
 <LI>The <B><A HREF="../optimizer/optimizer.html">optimizer</B></A> checks 
	the catalog and makes sure that the relations
	exist, that the user has used the proper attribute names, etc.
	Similar to type checking.  
 <LI>The <B><A HREF="../optimizer/optimizer.html">optimizer</A></B> then creates 
	possible plans, using heuristics and catalog
	information (e.g., cardinalities and availability of indexes) to find the
	best plan.
 <LI>The <A HREF="planner.html"><B>planner</B></A> then walks down the tree, 
	calling itself recursively. It creates an
	<B><A HREF="iterator.html">iterator tree</B></A>.
 <LI>At run-time, tuples are returned one at a time through the 
	a get_next call on the iterator at the root of the iterator tree.
</UL>

<H2>Details</H2>
There are two ways to return tuples of a query.  The first is to return a pointer
into the buffer pool to the record.  This would only work for simple scans, 
without projections or joins.  The limitations of this method are obvious, and it is 
made even more difficult because then the low level record space management 
(heap files for example) would pin the page in the buffer pool and the upper layer
would need to unpin the page.
<P>
The other method is to copy tuples into dynamically allocated main memory.  
This is the choice that was made in Minibase.
