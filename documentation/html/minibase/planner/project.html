<H3> Plan Interpreter Description </H3>

Task of the runtime plan interpreter is to walk the optimizer's plan tree
recursively and constructs the appropriate objects that will 
execute the query. Objects to construct are iterating over their input
tuples and produce output tuple which in turn might be the input for 
another iteration.
In this sence, all the relational operators and access methods are
special cases of iterators.
