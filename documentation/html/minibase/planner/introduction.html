The task of the runtime plan interpreter is to walk the optimizer's plan tree
recursively and constructs the appropriate objects that will
execute the query.
These objects turn out to be the C++ constructors of the various access 
methods.
In this sence, plan interpreter is a link between optimizer and the access 
methods.
Task of the plan interpreter is very much like the task of the code generator
in the case of the language compilers.
<P>
As we said, the interpreter main routine is the recursive one.
For the recursion to be possible, all the access method should have the same
general form. 
This is achieved by considering all the access methods to be the iterators
that are producing stream of tuples.
This way we can build the access methods on top of each other, i.e.
output of one iterator will be piped into the input of the next one.
<P>
Some of the iterators are unary, i.e. they just take one streams of tuples
as the input. Example of this would be the sort iterator. It takes only
one iterator as an input. On the other hand, typical join operation is
a binary iterator since it takes inner and outer relations as its input.
<P>
In our implementation of the various iterators we did not have conceptually
cleanest interface (in which all the joins would be binary iterators) 
because we were dependent on the given optimizer.
Optimizer was complex program that we started with and it was only slightly
changed during the course of project.
For example, indexed nested loops join is not implemented as the pure
binary operator beacause we did not want to introduce random access iterator,
the one that would be neede for the inner relation of join.
Because of this, index nested loops iterator takes only one (outer) iteator
as input and the whole inner relation for the other stream.
This little nonuniformity has added aditional (slight) complications to the
planner code, since it has more "if" statement than is necesary.
<p>
Conceptually, planner routine is the big recursive "switch" statements.
Sometimes it's not only enough to look into the current optimizer node to
conclude which oiterator to construct, i.e. we have to look what the
right hand child is. Example of this is the nested loops join.
To see what kind of nested loop join to construct we have to lookup the 
acces method of the right hand child. If the right hand child is the index 
scan than we have index nested loop join, otherwise we have simple nested
loop join.
