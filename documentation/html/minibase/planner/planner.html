<H2>Introduction</H2>
The task of the runtime plan interpreter is to walk the optimizer's plan tree 
recursively and to construct a tree of 
<A HREF="iterator.html"><B>iterators</B></A>.  An iterator is an
an object that (naturally!) iterates over a collection of input
tuples and produces a collection of output tuples.
In Minibase,
all the relational operators and access methods are 
special cases of iterators. 
<P>
The planner is thus basically a "translator" from a plan tree, produced
by the optimizer, to an iterator tree, which is the basis of runtime
execution.

<H2>Design Decisions</H2>
The iterator object was designed to provide a
consistent <i>get_next</i> interface
to link the output of one operator to another.  While scans
of heap files are identical in task to that of a file scan iterator, scans
of a relation using an index are different:  they must scan the index <B>and</B>
retrieve the tuple from the heap file.  Such details can be hidden,
when appropriate, through the use of the iterator abstraction.
<P>
Not all iterators are created by the planner.  Some are created by other 
iterators.  Go to the <B><A HREF="iterator.h">iterator page</A></B> for a 
more complete description.
