<H1> External Interface </H1>

<HR>
Interpreter is implemented as just another method of the 
<tt>PlanNode</tt>. <tt>PlanNode</tt> is the class name for the node of the
tree produced by the optimizer. Here is the interface:
<PRE>
  Iterator* PlanNode::interpret(AttributeList& attrs, Status& status);
</PRE>
Only input to the <tt> interpret</tt> is the implicit argument, the plan node
on which it is being called. Both <tt>attrs</tt> and <tt>status</tt> are
the output. <tt>status</tt> indicates whether the interpretation was
successfully completed while the <tt>attrs</tt> gives the list of attributes
of the tuple that will be returned by the output stream of the 
<tt>iterator</tt>.
Now that we had mention tuples, we should say more about it since it was
implemented by our group. Tuples are the structures that are returned
by the <tt>Iterator::get_next()</tt>function.
Here is the superclass of all the iterators:

<PRE>
class Iterator {

// All the relational operators and access methods are iterators.

public:
	virtual Status get_next(Tuple*& tuple) = 0;
   virtual ~Iterator(){};
};
</PRE>

This does not need much of explanation, all the iterators can do is return
the next tuple. Therefore we will present the <tt>Tuple</tt> interface.

<PRE>
class Tuple {

   // Tuples (or Records) will be typeless, i.e. we could not say what is
   // in tuple just by looking at it.
   // This means that whenever the tuples are passed around, additional
   // type information should be given separately.
   // Tuple is able to return stored data provided we ask for 
   // specific type.
   // To create the Tuple you WILL NOT use the constructor but
   // something like this:
   //
   //   Tuple* tuple = (Tuple*) new char[Tuple::max_size];
   //
   // Where int Tuple::max_size is defined globally.
   // Begining of the tuple MUST BE ON THE 4 BYTE BOUNDARY.

public:

   Tuple(){cerr << "Tuple constructor should never be called! \n";};

   int getFld(int fldNo, int& val);   // Convert this field into integer   
   
   float getFld(int fldNo, float& val); // Convert this field into float   

   char* getFld(int fldNo, char*& val); //Convert this field into string   

   char* getFld(int fldNo);      // Just return a char * pointer to the data

   Tuple* setFld(int fldNo, int val); // Set this field to integer value

   Tuple* setFld(int fldNo, float val); // Set this field to float value

   Tuple* setFld(int fldNo, char* val); // Set this field to string value

   static int max_size;   // Maximum size of any tuple 

   Status setHdr(short numFlds, AttrType types[], short strSizes[] = 0); 
   
   // setHdr will set the header of this tuple. If there is enough
   // space available returned status will be OK. 
   // Array strSizes contains the sizes of the strings 
   // (excluding trailing \0)
   // Array types contains the types that will be in this tuple.

   short size();      // Returns size of this tuple in bytes

   short noOfFlds();   // Returns number of fields in this tuple
   
   void print(AttrType type[], ostream& out = cout); 

   // Print this tuple to stream out, by default cout; 
</PRE>

Class <tt>Tuple</tt> is a very simple one. It should be stressed that the
data inside the tuple is aligned and therefore it is crucial that the
begining of the tuple is aligned too. 
<P>
Tuple is considered to be the
stream of bytes (untyped object) that can be interpreted only by the
functions that actually use it. Public interface is well commented and
there is no much that can be said in addition. Tuples are never created,
only the array of characters is mapped into tuple structure.
Tuple structure is set by the <tt>setHdr</tt> function. Actual data is set
by the appropriate <tt>setFld</tt> functions and data is retreived by the
appropriate <tt>getFld</tt> function. 
<P>
We should mention that the <tt>getFld</tt> function returns the appropriate
value at the two places. (as the function return and among the arguments).
This is confusing design but was implemented by popular demand.
<P>
There is one more interface implemented by us and that one transforms
various data representation from the optimizer form into the one agreed
to be used in this project. (Remeber, optimizer is the "foreign" body).
Therefore this class, which we called <tt>Converter</tt> is mainly used
by our group and is therefore semipublic, but it might be used by the
GUI interface and we are going to present it here.
<P>
Before we go on to presenting <tt>Converter</tt> let's briefly mention
which structures are used to describe fields and filters in the minirel.
The corresponding structure for the optimizer should be described in
the optimizer description.
We describe fields by telling to which relation they belong and what is
their sequential number. This all refers to the single iterator.
Here is the structure <tt>FldSpec</tt>:

<PRE>
enum RelSpec {outer, inner}; // Relation can be inner or outer

struct FldSpec {	// Field is specified by RelSpec and offset in the tuple
	RelSpec relation;
	int offset;
};
</PRE>
In the case of the unary iterator the relation designator is <tt>outer</tt>
by convention.
<P>
Filters, on the other hand are presented in the BCNF normal forms.
It means that the top level of conditions are logically connected with
AND operator while the lower level is connected by the OR operators.
Lower level is described by the linked list of the struct <tt>CondExpr</tt>.
Here is the format of <tt>CondExpr</tt>:

<PRE>
struct CondExpr {

// This structure will hold single select condition
// It is an element of linked list which is logically connected by OR operators

	AttrOperator op;	// Operator like "<"
	AttrType type1;
	AttrType type2;	// Types of operands 

	// Null AttrType means that operand is not a literal but an attribute name

	union {	// Operands can be any members of this union
		FldSpec symbol;
		char* string;
		int integer;
		float real;
	} operand1, operand2;

	CondExpr* next;	// Pointer to the next element in linked list
};
</PRE>

To conclude, we can describe arbitrarily complex boolean expressinon
by passing array of the pointers to the <tt>CondExpr</tt> (which are actually
pointers to linked list).
<P>
We now return to the <tt>Converter</tt> class that creates all these 
structures.
Note: This is <em>not</em> the complete interface for the <tt>Converter</tt>
since it is rather long and is
irelevant to other groups. I will present the rest of it in the
"internal design" section.

<PRE>

const int MAX_ATTR_LIST = 100;    // Maximum length of attribute list

class Converter {

// Converts various data structures that contains Attributes into the
// analagous structures that contain field specification. 

public:

   Converter(PlanNode* plan, AttributeList al);
   // Converter constructor takes PlanNode on which this conversion is to be
   // done and the attribute list of the CHILD node (this is unary converter).

   int convert(AttrType types[], short* strLens, RelSpec rel = outer);
   // This will return array of types and the string lengths for the
   // Attribute list given in constructor.
}
