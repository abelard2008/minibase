In retrospect, I think we should have built the tuple class without the
data alignment requirements because it was causing only the problems
and it wastes the space.
<p>
I could make my code more space efficient (at runtime only) if the
List class provided the member function <tt> length </tt> that would
return the length of the list.
Right now, we assume that it is bigger than some predefined constant.
<p>
We also think that the optimizer should uniquely identify all the 
attributes in the tree not only by name (which is string and hard
to hash) but by unique ID.
This way my code could be faster because I could build the hash
table on the available attributes in each plan node and I could
compare the attributes easily.
