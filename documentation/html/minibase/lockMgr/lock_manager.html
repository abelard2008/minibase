The lock manager has a very simple external interface. A request
can be made to lock a page, upgrade a lock, unlock a page, and unlock
all pages associated with a particular transaction.  Each running transaction 
has its own instance of the lock manager which it will use to lock and
unlock the pages it needs to access. If possible, a page should be locked
before it is actually requested from the buffer manager.
