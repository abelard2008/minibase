<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>External Interface </h2>

The public interface to the lock manager is contained in lock_manager.h  All
transactions wanting to use the lock manager must create an instance of the lock
manger, class lock_manager_def(), and an instance of its memory manger, class
sh_alloc(). Sh_alloc is defined in mem_manager.h  When the sh_alloc class is
created, an external pointer sh_alloc_ptr must be set to point to it.

    // If it is not possible, the OS will be asked to suspend this
    // process until the page becomes available. If the lock request
    // introduces a dependency cycle into the graph, the process
    // requesting the lock will be restarted.  A return code of Restart
    // indicates the transaction must be restarted. Lock page also handles
    // implicit upgrades.

    // An error code of Restart indicates the transaction must be restarted

    // lock you wish to hold on the page.

    // Exclusive locks can only be released by calling unlockall()

    // Unlock all pages locked by this process.  This will usually
    // be called by the OS at commit or abort time.
