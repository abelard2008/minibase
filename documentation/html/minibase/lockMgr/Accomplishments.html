<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Accomplishments</h2>
Since the lock manager did not exist in the previous mini-rel version, we had to
write the lock manager completely from scratch.  The lock in protocol and
especially the upgrade protocols had some very subtle details which took a while to
figure out and implement correctly.  The lock manager turned out to involve a
substantial amount of coding.  The program was longer due to the fact that it was
written in C++ which although more elegant, required a proliferation of functions.
The code was also complicated by the fact that it had to handle its own memory
management. <P>
     
To make testing easier, almost all classes in the lock manager contain print
functions. This was put to good use by the test driver which made it easy to see
if the lock manager was working correctly.  It tested and ran well with the OS
code in a multi-user environment with up to four instances of the lock manager
running concurrently.   <P>

Basically, we spent a good deal of time on the lock manager, codeing and recoding
to fit new specifications as we were made aware of them.  But probably the
majority of the time was spent trying to link it properly with other groups and
then debugging the really subtle and also blatant errors that came up during
testing.
