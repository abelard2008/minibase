<H3>Single User Testing</H3>
We assume that trivial single user tests are not
worth enumerating here as the main operation of
lock_manager is support for multi-user locking.
Many single user tests were run, and all passed.
Single Xact Upgrades, lock/unlock , and unlock all
were all "exhaustively" tested in single user mode, and repetitive testing
was used in an attempt to gauge the robustness of the code.
After many, many many lock/unlock/unlockall/upgrade/error causing
calls/multiple locks per page per transaction etc..., the code did not fail.

<H3>Multi User Testing:</H3>

<b>Test 1:</b> 3 way circular deadlock detection test.<P>
This is the basic deadlock detection test, and it is set up as
follows:
<ol>
<LI> Xact 1 locks page 1 ex mode
<LI> Xact 2 locks page 2 ex mode
<LI> Xact 3 locks page 3 ex mode
<LI> Xact 2 requests a lock on page 3 ex mode and sleeps
<LI> Xact 3 requests a lock on page 1 ex mode and sleeps
<LI> Xact 1 requests a lock on page 2 ex mode,
   causing deadlock, and is selected for restart.
</ol>
Note that Xact two still sleeps until Xact 3
releases the write lock.
After all transactions do a release all, each of
the buckets lock modes return to None.
This test tests deadlock detection, victim selection,unlockall, 
wakeup.<P>

<B>Test 2:</B> Simple Compatibility Groups.<P>
  This test tests to see if more than one Xact can enter the same locked queue.
the compatability groups followed the chart exactly.
If there was someone waiting, then even though the new request is
compatible with the current lock mode, it was put on the wait queue.<P>

<B>Test 3:</B> Waiting Compatibility Groups.<P>
  This test checks to see if a group of Xact's in the waiting queue
are correctly handled when they are awakened. The result is that 
the first group of compatible lock types is taken off the queue,
and every Xact after the first non-compatible waiter stays in the 
wait queue.

<B>Test 4:</B> Upgrades and Deadlock<P>
  This test makes sure that two people in the same locked queue can not
both do upgrades.  The second request causes a Restart error which is the correct
action. This tricky test was not obvious, but it works.<P>

<B>Test 6:</B> Error returns<P>
  This test makes sure that all error returns unlock the Lock_Table.
The only ones which may have been a problem were in upgrade because it is the only
highest level call which has multiple returns. Each return is preceded by an
unlock call so the tests all suceeded.<P>

<B>Test 7:</B> Many Locked pages test<P>
  This test tests that the internal memory system does not fail under heavy
traffic. It simply grabs 9 locks on 9 different pages done by 4 transaction,
resulting in 36 locked pages. It took a long time, but nothing died.
After each transaction did an unlockall, simulating commits, all lock_queues were
empty, and the lock mode on each page was None.<P>
