<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Retrospective</h2>

In retrospect some of the things we would change about the design of the lock
manager is the sh_alloc memory management class.  It would probably have been
better to break up its functionality between the different list classes by
overloading the new function for them.  <P>

Also, lock-elements are only reclaimed for use when the lock mangager looks
through the bucket which contains them.  It would be a better idea to reclaim them
as soon as its waiting and lock queues become empty.<P>

Some of the functions in the list class could be made more efficient.  We should
also probably change our public interface so it would no longer be necessary to
pass in the database name when requesting a page lock, upgrade, or unlock.<P>

For the project in general, it would have helped a lot if the os interface had
been fixed before we even started coding the lock manager.  The uncertainty of how
to interface with the OS made design decisions difficult. The dynamic evoultion of
the project at the weekly group meetings did work well and made the project
exciting.
