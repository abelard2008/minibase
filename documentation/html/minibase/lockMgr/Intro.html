<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Introduction</h2>

We implemented a page level lock manager for the Minirel DB system which provides
the following locking modes: 

  Intention Shared, Intention Exclusive, Shared and Exclusive locks on file pages.

In addition, the lock manager also handles deadlock detection.

Locking is done via the use of the following functions:
  
<PRE>
 Status lock_page(page_def &page,lock_type lock);
 Status upgrade_lock(page_def &page,lock_type lock); 
 Status unlock_page(page_def &page);
 Status unlockall();
</PRE>

The lock manager maintains a table which keeps track of the pages that each
transaction has locked.  Every time a new lock is requested, the subgraph
dealing with that page will be check for cycles. If a cycle is detected, then
the lock manager will select the transaction which just completed the cycle for
restarting.  It will then return this error to the transaction requesting the
lock.  Upon receiving this error, the transaction is then responsible for
restarting itself.

Whenever a transaction commits or aborts, it is the operating systems
responsibility to call the lock manager function, unlockall(), to unlock all the
pages that the transaction currently has locked.

The lock manager is intended to be used by functions are responsible for
accessing the database at the page level.  Before requesting a page from the
buffer manager, the function should first call the lock manager to get a lock on
that page.  

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER> Components Used by the Lock Manager</H3>

The lock manager depends upon the database operating system to run.  The
operating system is responsible for setting up the lock manager's data
structures in shared memory and providing access to them.  It does this by
either maintaining global pointers to these structures, or providing functions
that return pointers to these structures.  In the implementation, both of these
methods are used.  

The operating system also maintains a shared region around the lock managers
data structures so that only one instance of the lock manager can be
manipulating the data structures at any given time.  It is the lock managers
responsibility to lock its data structures in memory before accessing it and to
unlock it when it is done.
