<H4 ALIGN=CENTER> A graphical overview of the lock manager data structures in shared memory</H4>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Main Data Structures</H3>
      
The lock manager uses two main data structures created in shared memory.  The
first is the trans_lock_info class and the second is the lock_table class.<P>

<b>Trans_Lock_Info class:  </b>
The trans_lock_info class is a member of each transactions entry in the
transaction table.  As such, each instance is automatically created by the
operating system when the transaction executes the "begin" command. The
trans_lock_info class maintains a locked_queue linked list.  Each element in
this list points to a locked page entry, called a lock_entry, which represents
one of the pages on which it currently holds a lock.<P>

<b>Lock_Table class:</b>
The lock_table is created once in shared memory by the operating system, which
also maintains a global pointer to it.  This pointer is used only by the
lock_manager and should not be used by other processes.  The lock table keeps
track of all the pages which have been locked by some transaction and which pages
transactions are currently waiting to lock.  More specifically, the lock table is
a hash table of lock_entries.  Each lock_entry in the table represents a page that
has been locked.  The lock table also maintains list of free shared memory that
the lock manger previously allocated and are now available for reuse.  The
pointers are accessed and maintaind by the sh_alloc memory management class.<P>

<b>Lock_Entry class:</b>
A lock_entry maintains a locked_queue, which points to transactions which have
locked this page, and a waiting_queue, which points to the transactions which are
waiting to lock this page.<P>

<b>Lock_Manager & Deadlock_Detector class:</B>
The lock manager itself does not reside in shared memory but in the transactions
own local space. It is in fact created by the transaction after a begin call. 
As a data member it contains the deadlock_detector class.  This class is
reponsible for traversing the waiting lists in a lock_entry, and the locked lists
in a trans_lock_info entry to find if there are any cycles.  If so, then then
two or more transactions are in deadlock and one of them must be restarted. <P>

<H3 ALIGN=MIDDLE>Secondary Data Structures</H3>
<b>Sh_Alloc class:</b>
To manage shared memory that has already been allocated, the sh_alloc class was
created.  It keeps trak of list entries and lock entries which are no longer in
use so that they can be reused when the need arises.<P>

To make the comparison of different lock modes easer, the lock_mode_class was
created to overload the >,<,=,== functions.  Greater Than and Less Than rank
lock modes in terms of exclusiveness.  An exclusive lock therefore holds the
highest value and no lock, None, holds the lowest.  The equality operator ,==,
comparares two lock modes to determine if they are compatible.  It returns true
if they are compatible and false otherwise.<P>

A second class, page_id_class was created to make the comparison of page id's
easier.  A page id consists of a page number and the filename in with that page
resides.  The functions = and == were overloaded on this class.<P>

To maintain the locked lists and waiting lists the classes lock_list and
trans_list were created.  Lock lists are maintained by the transaction, within
the trans_lock_info class, are are used to point to lock entries in the
lock table.  Trans lists are maintained by lock entries to keep track of who is
waiting to lock them, and who has already obtained a lock.  Trans lists point
back to trans_lock_info entries.  Both of these lists inherit publically from
the list class which actually contains most of the code for managing lists.<P>

<H3 ALIGN=MIDDLE>The Locking Protocol</H3>

When a transaction requests a lock on a page, the lock_page function for that
page(lock_entry), is called.  The function first checks to see if the
transaction already holds a lock on the page.  If it does, the system assumes
that an implicit upgrade has been requested.<P>

<B>Implicit Upgrades:</B><P>
If the upgrade is compatible with the highest lock mode held on that page, then
the current lock entry is upgraded to the new mode.  If the new lock mode is
incompatible with the higest lock mode on that page, then a new entry is created
for the request and it is placed at the front of the waiting queue. The
transaction is then put to sleep.<P>

If the lock mode that we want to upgrade to is incompatible with the current
highest lock mode held on that page, and someone in my current compatibility
group is already waiting for an upgrade, then we are restarted.  This is done
because there is no way that both us and the transaction waiting for the upgrade
can get a lock without violating 2PL.  If granted this would also form a
dependency cycle between the two transactions waiting for an upgrade.<P>

When the lock queue drains of locks and becomes empty, then then next compatible
group from the waiting queue is removed and they are woken up.  If one of
these transaction was waiting for an upgrade, its entry which is still in the
locked queue is upgraded at this time.<P>

<B>Normal Locks:</B><P>
If we are not doing an upgrade, then the waiting queue is checked to see if
there are already people waiting to get on the locked queue.  If so, then we are
put on the end of the waiting queue and put to sleep.<P>
 
If there is no one on the waiting queue, and our lock mode is compatible with
the current highest lock held on that page, then we are granted a lock and added
to the lock list for this page.  The transactions lock list is also updated to
indicate the fact that it has now locked this page.<P>

If the lock mode we are requesting is incompatible with the lock mode on the
page, then we go to the end of the waiting queue and are put to sleep.<P>

<B>Sleeping Transactions:</B><P>

Transactions which are sleeping because they are waiting for a lock or waiting
for an upgrade to come through, are woken up when their requested lock mode
makes them compatible with the current higest lock held on a page.  This
checking is done everytime a transaction unlocks a page.  When a transaction is
woken up, the lock_page function in the lock manager will then re-request the
lock on that page.<P>


<H3 ALIGN=MIDDLE>Deadlock Detection</H3>

The deadlock detection function is run whenever a transaction has requested a
lock on a page and told it must go to sleep.  At this point, it's request has
been placed on the waiting queue.  The deadlock algorithm then checks the
sub-graph dealing with that page to see if it finds any cycles.  <P>

To do this, the transaction starts with the transactions locked list which
contains pointers to all the lock entries which the transaction holds a lock on.
These entries are traversed down to the corresponding lock entries.  The wait
queue in each lock entry is then traversed to see if they contain a path back to
the transaction.  If so, then a cycle has been found and all the transactions
locks are released and it is requested to restart.<P>
