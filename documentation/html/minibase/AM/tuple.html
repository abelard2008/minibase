<h1>Introduction </h1>
Each record in a relation is a collection of bytes that
is cast as an object of type <EM>Tuple</EM>.  
Only implementors of access methods, heap files and relational operators
need to worry about how the bytes are utilized .
Others can treat them as just a collection of bytes.  
<P>
<I>Tuples</I> may have attributes of three types: <B>strings</B> (up to 255 characters),
<B>integers</B>, and <B>real</B> numbers (floats, in C++).
<P>
Because padding of bytes is needed to align integers and floats,
the exact number of bytes in a <I>Tuple</I> is not known ahead of time.
When tuples are created, a large number of bytes must be allocated.
Then the attributes list (for example: int, int, float) 
is passed to the tuple and the tuple is constructed.  During the 
<I>Tuple</I> construction, padding is performed and the actual size of the 
<I>Tuple</I> with those attributes is determined.

<H2>Design Decisions</H2>
Padding was chosen over copying for no particular reason.  The amount
of space wasted due to padding may not offset the time that is needed
to copy the data into aligned space when it is needed; thus, a variant
that uses copying could be used instead.
<P>
In Minibase, a tuple must fit on a single page.
