<H2>Introduction</H2>
An access method (or index) facilitates retrieval of a desired record
from a relation.  In Minibase, all records in a relation are stored in
a Heap File.  An index consists of a collection of records of the
form (key value,rid), where `key value' is a value for the 
<B>search key</B> of the index, and `rid' is the id of a record
in the relation being indexed.  Any number of indexes can be
defined on a relation.

<B><A HREF="../BTree/BTree.html">B+ Tree</A></B> and 
<B><A HREF="../linearHash/linearHash.html">Linear Hash</A></B> 
indexes are supported.  (The Linear Hashing code has not
been tested in this release!)
<P>
Minibase only supports non-clustered indexes.
Implementing clustered indexes would require major changes.
(The <B><A HREF="../optimizer/optimizer.html">optimizer</A></B>,
however, can correctly handle clustered vs. non-clustered 
indexes.  Of course, this is only useful while running the optimizer
in stand-alone mode.)

<H2>Design Decisions</H2>
All access methods are based on a <B><A HREF="index.txt">common C++ base class.</A></B>
A particular access method can be understood in terms of its
<EM>file structure</EM> (which determines how the pages in the index file
are organized), <EM>page structures</EM> (typical page format), and
the functionality of <EM>scans</EM> (e.g., whether range scans are
supported).
