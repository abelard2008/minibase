<H1>The Minibase Front-End</H1>

The Minibase GUI front-end allows 
users to invoke almost all database functions, and is described below.
It can be run using the command <b>minibaseview</b>.

<H2>Design and Implementation</H2>

The current version of the GUI is written using the base Tcl/Tk
toolkit (by John Ousterhout, available from Sun Microsystems and
UC-Berkeley) and extensions to it (various authors).  The GUI
runs as a separate process, invokes the Minibase backend (which
forms the core database engine), and communicates with the
backend through Unix pipes.  The GUI is best run with the
single-user version of the Minibase backend, but the following
descriptions do not change in any significant way for multi-user
Minibase.
<P>

The proper versions of the Tcl/Tk toolkit and extensions are
necessary to run the GUI---these toolkits are part of the
Minibase distribution and need to be installed as appropriate.

<H2>Operating Modes</H2>

The GUI operates in three modes:
(1) The Catalog Editor mode.  (2) The Query Optimizer mode.  (3) The
Database mode.
Some of the functionality of the GUI is common to all modes while
some commands are available only in certain modes.  The
transition from one mode to the other in the GUI is generally
transparent to the user---they are mentioned here only to simply
the description of the front-end.
<P>

Global and context-sensitive help is available for most parts of
the GUI; it is also simple and easy enough to use that the user
can figure out most of the functionality by experimenting with
the tool.


<H3>The Catalog Editor Mode</H3>

On invocation, the GUI starts out in the Catalog Editor mode.
Although, the GUI process spawns and connects (via Unix pipes) to
the Minibase backend, it does not yet allow the user to invoke
any database related functions.
<P>

The only functional part of the GUI is the Catalog Editor.  The
Catalog Editor provides a syntax directed, forms-based interface
to creating and editing Minibase catalogs (without the user
having to understand the underlying catalog format).
<P>

Minibase catalogs created and edited via the Catalog Editor are
stored as files i.e. they are not automatically associated with
the Minibase backend or with any databases.


<H3>The Query Optimizer Mode</H3>

When a Minibase catalog is "opened" (rather than "created" or
"edited"), the GUI switches to the Query Optimizer mode.  In this
mode, all of the Catalog Editor functions are still available.
From this point on, the GUI switches back and forth between the
Query Optimizer and Database modes only---it does not revert to
the Catalog Editor mode (however, all Catalog Editing functions
remain accessible to the user).
<P>

In the Query Optimizer mode, the user can type SQL queries
against the "opened" catalog (henceforth, "current catalog"),
have the query optimized (i.e. have various query plans generated
by the Minibase backend and the best plans selected).  The
selected query plans are then displayed in the main window of the
GUI.  These plans can then be examined in detail.  The user can
also make various refinements to the plans via "toggles"
available in the GUI menus and observer the effects of changes in
query optimization strategy on the selection of different plans
by the optimizer.
<P>

Examples exercises and catalogs are included in 
the directory <i>programs/opttool/catalogs</i>.
The catalogs and exercises
test various parts of the optimizer and demonstrate the effects
of indexes, access costs, query selectivity, joins, sorting, data
clustering, and so on.
<P>

In the Query Optimization mode, no query plan is actually
evaluated against any data since the current catalog is not
associated with any actual database.


<H3>The Database Mode</H3>

When the user "opens" a database, the GUI switches from its
previous mode (Catalog Editor or Query Optimizer) to the Database
mode.  As mentioned before, all Catalog Editor functions are
still available.  The Minibase backend loads the "opened"
database (henceforth "current database") and performs any
necessary initializations.  At this point, a number of additional
functions are available to the user.
<P>

Every valid Minibase database has an internal catalog---when
users create new databases, they need to associate a catalog with
each database.  Existing catalogs may also be modified (however,
the GUI cannot be used for modifying catalogs bound to
databases---the Minibase C++ interface should be used for making
changes to the bound catalogs).
<P>

Users can invoke all database operations: inserting and deleting
tuples into relations, and updating them.  Data can also be read
in from, and printed out to files/printers.  In addition to these
database functions, users can also perform all the functions
available in the Query Optimization mode and execute query
plans against the relations/tuples in the database.
<P>

The Database mode remains active until the user "opens" a
catalog---when the GUI switches to the Query Optimizer mode.

<H2>Termination and Cleanup</H2>

The GUI can be terminated in one of two ways.  Menu buttons
provide for a graceful exit, in which case the Minibase backend
is properly shutdown and the GUI terminates; and an abort
function, in which case the Minibase backend and GUI are
terminated.  The "abort" may be required if the Minibase backend
is unable to recover from any error (some syntax errors in user
commands may cause a loss of synchronization between the GUI and
the backend).
