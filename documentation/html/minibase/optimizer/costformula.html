<H2>Access Method Costs</H2>

<P> If all attributes used in either the selection or
projection in a plan node can be supplied by
the index, that node will be marked as being an index-only plan.
In such a plan, the indexed relation need not be accessed, and this
is reflected in the following costs.

<H2> Joins</H2>

In general, we assume all joins are pipelined; that is, the results of one
join are directly fed into the next.


<H3>Index Nested Loops</H3>
<P>   The optimizer never considers whether the left plan was already
ordered or not.   If we could make a guess on how many keys are entering in
the left hand side, we could then use the L.NKeys instead of L.NTuples in
the formulas, which could be cheaper.

<P>  The cost estimate is computed using the following formula for 
joining plan R and plan L, where R is the right subplan and L is the 
left:
<PRE>
      L.TotalCost + (L.Cardinality * R.Access)
</PRE>

<P>Where R.Access is the cost to get one tuple.  Note, that RF(Primary) is the
selectivity of the join, so the selectivity for just one probe should be (RF(Primary) /
L.NTuples) if we have L.NTuples probes.  So, what I did was grab the cost for R.Access
from the access-method level lookups & then did some algebra to simplify it
up a little bit.  This would be a high estimate if the left plan was sorted
& the index is clustered.  (Note, that these will work in non-equijoin joins
if the index supports equijoins)

<H3>Sort Merge</H3>

<P>Hash indexes are not allowed. 

<P>In general, the cost is the cost to sort one or both incoming relations,
if necessary, plus the cost to access each one once.  (If there is an index,
it will include the cost to use the index)

<P>We also assume we can always sort in two runs (not always reasonable)

<P>Note; we assume that sort-merge is done in two distinct steps -- a sort
step, and a merge step.  It assumes (like the current version of minibase)
that merging is not done at the same time as the last sort run.

<H2>Order By, Group By, Distinct, and Aggregates</H3>

<P>Aggregates are `free'.  If all aggregates can be computed using some index,
and index-only plan is produced.  (However, all the aggregates must be
computable from the same index.  It could be cheaper to instead scan two
different indexes and join them together, but the optimizer isn't smart
enough to consider this currently.)

<P>Order By and Group By: Group by and distinct are done by sorting the
relation and then stepping through the different groups; after this point
they are not significantly different as far as the optimizer is concerned
from a similar order by clause.

<P>If the plan is
already in the order desired, 
there is no additional cost.  Otherwise, <tt>4 * NP</tt> is added to the cost
of the plan to sort the relation.
