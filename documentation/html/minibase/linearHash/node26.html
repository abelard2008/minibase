Since the position of the record to be deleted is known, we can just
move the last record on the last page to the current slot and
decrement <em>current_slotno</em> by 1. If an overflow page is
deallocated because of the deletion, a merge is triggered.  If the
bucket to be merged (the last bucket) is neither the bucket we are
scanning nor its image, then the normal merge operation described
previously can be used here without any modification.
Otherwise, if we still use the same merge operation, the values of <em>current_pageno</em> and <em>current_slotno</em> could be changed due to
records movement. In order to minimize the cost and complexity, we
designed a special scheme which is illustrated in the following two
cases: 
<UL><LI> Case 1: the image of the scanned bucket is the last bucket.
Since a merge is triggered only when an overflow page is deallocated
and we know it's triggered this time after a currently scanned record
(in the scanned bucket) is deleted, we can deduce that the scanned
bucket consists of some number of <b>full</b> pages. So we can just
concatenate all the pages of its image bucket (i.e. the last bucket)
to its last page and only the <em>OverflowPageNo</em> on the last page
needs to be changed to the PageId of the first page of its image
bucket. If its image bucket has only one empty page, nothing needs to
be changed. The whole process is illustrated in Figure 2.

<LI> Case 2: the scanned bucket is the last bucket. Again, (as in
case 1,) we know that the scanned bucket consists of some number of
<b>full</b> pages. We can concatenate all the pages of the image bucket
of the scanned bucket to the last page of the scanned bucket as in
case 1. But this time the scanned bucket is to be destroyed, Hence we
change the PageId of the primary page of the image bucket (on some
DirPage) to the PageId of the scanned bucket to keep the whole
structure consistent. The whole process is
illustrated in Figure 3.

Note that after these operations, all bucket pages are still compact.
Besides, the vales of <em>current_pageno</em> and <em>current_slotno</em>
are unchanged. One drawback of this scheme is that the continuing scan
after the merge will then scan all the pages concatenated to the last
page of the scanned bucket where no matched records can be found since
they belonged to the image bucket of the scanned bucket before the
merge. In order to improve the performance, we set a member of the
<b>LinearHashingScan</b> object, <em>last_pageno</em>, to the PageId of
the first page concatenated to the scanned bucket. When the scan reads
this page, it knows that it's the end of the scan and NOMORERECS is
returned. (See Figure 2 and Figure 3.)
The above reasoning is based on the fact that when
a scan is opened, no update operation is allowed except <em>delete_current()</em>.
