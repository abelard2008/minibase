Before I started this project, I read the code of the extensible hashing
component in the old MINIREL. Since linear hashing's data structures are
very different from extensible hashing's, I designed and implemented
the system almost from the scratch. <BR>The linear hashing component
currently consists of approximately 2300 lines of fully documented
C++ code. The single user version has been extensively tested and is
working stably. It's also purified and no purify errors were
reported in this component. I also finished writing update logs and
controlling concurrent accesses to the index. Since the Recovery
Manager and Lock Manager have not finished when the report was
written, no mutil-user test has been run on this component. Currently
I just set all the methods of those two components to empty functions.<BR>For me the difficult parts in this project include extremely rare
cases handling, e.g. merging in scan, and locking.
