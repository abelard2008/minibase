<H3>Info about what happens when a process is created and 
how a DB is created</H3>

<HR>


<H2>Creating a DataBase</H2>


 When a DataBase is created (using the front end utility), many things
will happen.  The DataBase will be named by the user, and a directory with 
that name will be created.  Within that directory will be <B>three UNIX
files:</B> one for the DB (the tuples, indicies, etc..), one for the log, and one
for the catalog.
<P>
 Each of these must be specified.  A <B><EM>naming convention</B></EM> for 
naming these files will be specified (maybe like this:<BR>
       DataBase name = my_db<BR>
       logfilename   = my_db.log<BR>
       dbname        = my_db.data<BR>
       catalogname   = my_db.catalog )<BR>
<P>

<H2>Starting a Process</H2>

When a process is created, it needs to be able to find the correct UNIX
file.  So every DB object must be passed a name.  Most likely, the user
will create the process by typing "minirel my_db".  Then the main
function will parse the command line and append the string with ".log" 
and ".data" and start each of the DB objects.  
<P>
Several objects need to be created when a process begins.  If it is the first
process, it must allocate shared memory.  Other processes will then 
detect that the shared memory has been allocated and will attach to it when
the SharedMemory class is instantiated.  
<P>
The various managers must be instantiated as well.  This may be done by the
SharedMemory constructor.
<P>
Some of the values that are currently stored as "const int's" in "minirel.h"
will NOT remain this way.  Some may be specified at the command line or in
some other fashion.  At any rate, their instantiation will occur early and
will not occur in the different managers.  
<P>
