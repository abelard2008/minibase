<H1>Overview of Minirel II</H1>

<H2>Single-User</H2>
	At the top level is an SQL parser and query optimizer.  A graphical
front end is being finished as well which will allow easy access to
an expanded suite of utility functions, such as loading relations from
a file into the database and creating indicies and relations.  Underneath 
the optimizer is a runtime planner.  When the user enters an SQL query,
the parser constructs a plan tree.  It consults the <EM>catalogs</EM> as
it does so in order to do type checking.  The optimizers uses various 
heuristics (pushing selects, checking for indicies) and prepares the tree 
for the runtime planner.  The optimizer decides how to join the various 
relations specified in the query.
<P>
	The runtime planner in turn creates the appropriate join methods
and iterators to produce tuples to the (currently unfinished) front end.
<P>
	The next layer is the relational operators layer.  File scans, 
sorting, and joins, all fall into this layer.  These operations in turn
access the access methods (indicies) on the system.  
<P>
	In Minirel II, all tuples are stored in heap files, which can be
scanned sequentially, or accessed through one of two indicies: BTrees and
linear hash.  
<P>
	The buffer manager maintains the buffer pool for the DBMS.


<H2>Concurrency</H2>
	At the base of Minirel II is the Operating System layer.  Managers 
in shared memory handle all aspects of concurrency in Minirel II, including 
locking, logging, recovery, and page replacement and allocation.  Upon 
startup, if the managers exist in shared memory, the process attaches 
its pointers to the different managers.  If the shared memory segments do 
not exist, then the managers are instantiated and the first process proceeds 
normally.  Semaphores are used to restrict access to critical sections of 
these managers, such as the lock table, since these managers reside in 
shared memory, it is important that only one process be active in certain 
sections at once.
<P>
	ARIES recovery was implemented into the Minirel II project.  An 
additional UNIX file, the log, was introduced.  A log tail exists for every 
UNIX process.  The log / recovery / buffer management systems all work so 
that WAL is enforced.  Every page contains an LSN, so that the system can 
enforce proper recovery.  The recovery system conforms to ARIES.  There is 
an analysis phase, where the first LSN is discovered, and where the earliest 
checkpoint is discovered.  Redo and undo are performed as well.  
<P>
	Locking is done at the Page level to prevent dirty writes and other
concurrency problems that arise in a multi-process system.

<H2>Some Details of the System</H2>

<B>Records:</B> They are often treated as just a raw number of bytes, but 
relational operators cast them as <EM>tuples</EM>.  Some padding is done 
internally so that attributes are aligned properly.
<P>
<B>Record Storage:</B> There are no clustered inicies in Minirel II.  All records
are stored in heap files.
<P>
<B>Data Types:</B> Attributes of these types are supported. strings (max size of 
255 characters), real numbers (C floats), and integers.
