   The <strong>minibase_globals</strong> variable is a pointer to a
   SystemDefs object.  The SystemDefs class has public data members
   for the various components of the system: the buffer manager, the
   disk space manager, and so on.  These are referred to throughout
   the Minibase code by C preprocessor macros declared in
   system_defs.h&emdash;for example, MINIBASE_BM for the buffer
   manager.

<P>

   This object, minibase_globals, is responsible for creating all its
   constituent objects to create or open a Minibase database, and for
   destroying them all to close it again.  You open a database by
   creating a SystemDefs object and assigning it to minibase_globals,
   and you close it by deleting minibase_globals.

<P>

   There can only be one instance of the SystemDefs class, and it is
   always pointed to by minibase_globals.

<H2> The SystemDefs Class </H2>

   The base SystemDefs class provides slots for the buffer manager
   (BufMgr class, called MINIBASE_BM), the disk space manager (DB
   class, called MINIBASE_DB), and the name of the Unix file that
   holds the database (called MINIBASE_DBNAME).  In addition, the
   multi-user version has many more slots, for the shared memory
   manager, the transaction manager, the log manager, and so on.

<H2> The ExtendedSystemDefs Class</H2>

   ExtendedSystemDefs is a subclass of SystemDefs that adds the
   Minibase catalogs to the structure.  When you need to use the
   catalog system, i.e. when you are working with relations rather
   than the lower-level components of Minibase, you create an
   ExtendedSystemDefs object in place of a SystemDefs object.

<P>

   In addition to managing the catalog objects for Minibase proper,
   ExtendedSystemDefs also creates a systemCatalogs object (see below)
   that knows how to read the Minibase catalogs.  This includes the
   optimizer, which can operate autonomously from a Minibase database,
   into the system and lets it work with real data.

<P>

   The reason for separating the catalogs from the rest of the system
   is simply to allow the lower levels of the software to be used
   without imposing the higher-level structure required by the
   catalogs.

<H1> systemCatalogs </H1>

   The systemCatalogs global variable is a pointer to an
   ii_SystemCatalogs object.  The ii_SystemCatalogs class is an
   abstract class that returns information about the current catalog
   for use by the optimizer subsystem.

<P>

   There are two concrete subclasses of ii_SystemCatalogs:
   ii_BogusSystemCatalogs and ii_MinibaseSystemCatalogs.  The "bogus"
   one reads a "bogus catalog" file, which is a text file that
   contains catalog information without the need for an actual
   database behind it.  This is useful for learning about how
   optimizers work in different catalog environments.  The other one
   actually reads the Minibase global catalogs of the current open
   database.
