<H1>Evolution of the System</H1>

	Work got under way in early March when project teams formed and began
to design their interfaces.  As expected, the interface negotiation proved to
be a thorny problem, and interface changes were made as late as May.
<P>
	Minor problems arose throughout the course of the project as it
developed, but there are a few that are especially important.
<P>
	Multiple DataBases:  There was some confusion as to how many separate
databases (implemented as separate UNIX files) the Minirel II DBMS would 
support at one time.  It was decided that multiple DBs should be supported,
resulting in minor changes to the interfaces of groups, most notably the
log manager.  Only late in the project, however, was it discovered that only
one DB could be opened at any given time because of the way in which UNIX
assigns file descriptors to processes.
<P>
	Minibase integration: Using the Minibase optimizer, parser, and some
of the catalog design meant that a large amount of work was spent between the
planner, catalogs, front end, and optimizer groups hammering out interfaces.
<P>
Overall, however, design issues did not cause any delays or major problems
in the progress of the project.
<P>

<H2>Errors</H2>
Minirel II uses an error protocol whereby errors are chained together
by a global error object.  The path from the original error to its 
detection at the user level can be accessed.  This error protocol was
written with the original Minirel protocol in mind.  Only minor changes 
were required.


<H2>Global Identifiers</H2>
There are several global identifiers woirth mentioning.  Each shared memory
system requires a pointer so that every process can access it.  These include
the buffer manager, log manager, recovery manager, disk space manager, and
the lock manager.
