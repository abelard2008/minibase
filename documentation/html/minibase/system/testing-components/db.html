<H2>Test 1</H2>
This test creates a database and does some normal operations. 
It adds some file entries and then allocates a run of pages.
Some of these pages are written on. The rest of them are 
deallocated. The database created here is used in the later
tests. 

<P>

<H2>Test 2</H2>
Opens the database created by test 1.  Some of the files created 
in test 1 are deleted. Lookups of the remaining file entries
are performed. Then data is read from the pages written in test1
and checked for correctness.

<P>

<H2>Test 3</H2>
This test checks some erroneous operations like 
<it>looking up a deleted file entry, deleting a non-existent
file entry, looking up a non-existent file entry, adding a 
duplicate file entry, adding a file entry whose name is too long,
allocating a run of pages longer than the maximum allowed</it>.

<P>
<IMG SRC="../../pics/hline.gif">
<H2>Test 4</H2>
This test checks the boundary conditions.
The database created in test 1 is removed. Then, it creates a new 
database
and then allocates all the pages available in the database. 
Deallocates some of these pages and again allocates some of them.
The directory size is increased to more than one page by adding enough 
file entries. Again tries to allocate a page when none is available. 
Finally, the database is destroyed.
