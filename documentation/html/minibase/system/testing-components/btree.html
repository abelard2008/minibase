<H1>BTree Test Page</H1>


<IMG SRC="../../pics/hline.gif">
<P>

These tests require that the file "keys" be in the same directory 
as the Minibase executable.
<P>
The Btree tests periodically stop to allow the user to examine individual pages
in the tree.  The header, root, internal and leaf pages may be examined to see
what pages are next to one another.  A visual interface is added to 
visualize the structure of the tree.
<P>

<H2>Test 1</H2>
Create an index and insert key / rid pairs into it.  In Test 1
keys are integers.  The keys are inserted in ascending order.
The maximum number of keys that can be inserted into the tree
is set at 4000 (enough to create three levels of the tree).
A random deletion of 10% of the key/rid pairs is done.  
<P>
Test the range scans: <I>All Scan</I>, <I>Max Range Scan</I>, <I>Min Range
Scan</I>, and <I>Min-Max Range Scan</I>.  Also <I>Exact Match</I>.
Delete current is done as well. The tree is not destroyed because
Test 2 uses it.
<P>

<H2>Test 2</H2>
In Test 2, scans are performed that make no sense (e.g., 
low values higher than
the high values, etc.).  The index that was created in Test 1 is used 
for testing these scans.  The scans should return no tuples.  They should not
return any errors.  Finally, the Btree index is destroyed. 
<P>

<H2>Test 3</H2>
In this test, the full deletion algorithm is exercised. 
After inserting 2000 integer key/rid pairs, 1950 of these 
are deleted. 2000 keys are sufficient to create two levels
of the tree. At this point, the user is allowed to examine
the root and leaf pages. Due to the deletions, the root page
is converted back to a leaf page (from an index page) as it 
can hold 50 records. Again, various scans are tested and then
the index is destroyed. 
<P>

<H2>Test 4</H2>
Basically the same as Test 1 and Test 2 combined, 
except that instead of an integer
key, a string is used.  The keys read from the file "keys" (in the 
same directory as the Minibase executable) are inserted in 
lexicographic order. Deletion of a particular key and different
types of scans as in Test 1 are done. Like in Test 2, abnormal 
scans are tested. Finally, the index is destroyed.
