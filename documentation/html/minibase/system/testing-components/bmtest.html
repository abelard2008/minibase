<H1>Buffer Manager Test Page</H1>

<IMG SRC="../../pics/hline.gif">

<P>
The buffer manager reads disk pages int a main memory page as needed.
The collection of main memory pages (called <EM>frames</EM>) used
by the buffer manager for this purpose is called the 
<EM>buffer pool</EM>. This is just an array of <B>Page</B> objects.
The buffer manager is used by access methods, heap files and 
relational operators to read/write/allocate/deallocate pages. 
A run of pages can be allocated with a single call. 
The Buffer Manager uses the interface to the underlying DB
class object which actually performs these functions on disk
pages. 
<P>
The buffer manager can also return the dirty page table when 
needed. This information is required for checkpointing in 
multi-user Minibase (which uses the ARIES recovery protocol).
Replacement policies can be changed easily at compile-time.

<H2>Test 1</H2>
All normal operations are checked here. A run of pages is
allocated, each page in the run is written upon and then unpinned (with
the dirty flag set to TRUE).
Later, each page is pinned again and the data on each page is compared
with the data written on it (obviously, it has to be the same). 
Finally, all the pages are freed.

<H2>Test 2</H2>
Test 2 does some illegal buffer manager operations. First, it tries
to pin more pages than there are frames in the buffer pool. This operation
should fail. It also tries to free a pinned page, and tries to unpin an
already unpinned page. Again, these operations should fail. 

<P>

<H2>Test 3</H2>
Test 3 allocates several new pages, dirties them and randomly 
leaves some of them pinned. 
All the newly allocated pages are pinned again, which
means some of the pages are doubly pinned. Data written on them is
checked and then all the pages are unpinned.
