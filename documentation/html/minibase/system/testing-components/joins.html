<H2>Overview</H2>

These tests show how three relations are joined together in various
ways.  The three relations show how sailors of various skills make
reservatons to rent different boats at the club.<P>
<B>
<I>sailors (sid, sname, rating, age)</I> - int, string, int, real<BR>
<I>boats (bid, bname, bcolor)</I> - int, string, string<BR>
<I>reserves (sid, bid, date)</I> - int, int, string<BR>
</B>
<P>
The tests of the joins are done by using <I>faked</I> iterators,
and feeding these into the joins.  The only two joins that are
demonstrated are  sort-merge and nested-loops.  Sorting, duplicate
elimination, projection and selection are all demonstrated as well.
<P>
The iterators are just arrays with the tuples in them, and calls to 
get_next just increment the index.  All the plans are created "by
hand" also (the optimizer, parser and planner are not used).
<P>
Other joins have been coded by this team, but these joins were
not brought into the testing menu.  These hash-based joins (as
well as a few others) are not supported by the Minibase
optimizer.  They should be demonstrated anyway, but I decided against
spending the extra time doing it.

<H2>Query 1</H2>
Query: Find the names of sailors who have reserved boat number 1.<P>
SELECT S.sname<BR>
FROM   Sailors S, Reserves R<BR>
WHERE  S.sid = R.rid AND R.bid = 1<BR>
<P>
This query uses a sort merge join with sailors as the outer relation and
reserves as the inner relation.  The sailor name is projected at the end of 
the join.
<P>

<H2>Query 2</H2>
Query: Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red boat 
and return then in alphabetical order.<P>
SELECT   S.sname<BR>
FROM     Sailors S, Boats B, Reserves R<BR>
WHERE    S.sid = R.rid AND R.bid = B.bid AND B.color = 'red'<BR>
ORDER BY S.sname<BR>
<P>
Plan used:<P>
Sort (Pi(sname) (B  |><|  Pi(sname, bid) (S  |><|  R)))<BR>
<P>
Two nested loops joins are used, with the result of the sailors & reserves join
forming the outer input of the second join (boats being the inner relation).
The result is sorted.

<H2>Query 3</H2>
Query: Find the names of sailors who have reserved a boat.<P>
SELECT S.sname<BR>
FROM   Sailors S, Reserves R<BR>
WHERE  S.sid = R.rid<BR>
<P>
A sort-merge join.
<P>

<H2>Query 4</H2>
Query: Find the names of sailors who have reserved a boat
and print each name once.<P>
SELECT DISTINCT S.sname<BR>
FROM   Sailors S, Reserves R<BR>
WHERE  S.sid = R.rid<BR>
<P>
A sort-merge join that eliminates duplicates. 
<P>
<IMG SRC="../../pics/hline.gif">

<H2>Query 5</H2>
Query: Find the names of old sailors or sailors with a rating less
than 7, who have reserved a boat, (perhaps to increase the
amount they have to pay to make a reservation<P>
SELECT S.sname, S.rating, S.age<BR>
FROM   Sailors S, Reserves R<BR>
WHERE  S.sid = R.rid and (S.age > 40 OR S.rating < 7)<BR>
<P>
A sort-merge using a complex selection.
