<H2>Test 1</H2>
Insert up to 1000 key / rid pairs into the index.
<P>

<H2>Test 2</H2>
In Test 2, scans are performed that make no sense (e.g., 
low values higher than
the high values, etc.).  The index that was created in Test 1 is used 
for testing these scans.  The scans should return no tuples.  They should not
return any errors.  
<P>

<H2>Test 3</H2>
Basically the same as Test 1, except that instead of an integer
key, a string is used.  The keys are inserted in ascending order, as
in Test 1.
<P>

<H2>Test 4</H2>
The same as Test 3, except that the keys are inserted in descending
order.  
<!This test has a PROBLEM.  The sibling pointers (from right
to left) are not done correctly.  There is a problem in the splitting.
Fortunately, this feature is not used in Minibase, though it should be
changed later.>
