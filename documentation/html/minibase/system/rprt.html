<H1>Minirel II Project Report</H1>
<HR>
Peter Feakins (pfeakins@students.wisc.edu) and Bill Kimmel (kimmel@cs.wisc.edu)
<BR>

This report focuses on the goals, accomplishments, current status, and future
of Minirel II (this is what we are calling our Minirel, to differentiate 
between it and the DeWitt Minirel).
<BR>
To some extent, the concurrency aspects of Minirel II were given secondary 
status in this report.  Problems with the single user version of Minirel II
make it necessary to discuss them first.  Also, while documentation and
descriptions of the concurrency mechanisms for Minirel II exist elsewhere,
see the log, recovery, lock and OS groups, this is not the case for the 
single user version.  The parser, optimizer and a general overview are
not discussed anywhere else, thus the emphasis on the single user version.
