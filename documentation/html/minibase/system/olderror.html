<H2>Old Error Conventions</H2>
<B>Dewitt-minirel</B>: An enumerated type, <I>Status</I>, is used to
show what error was encountered.  When errors are detected, the program 
exits.
<P>
<B>Old Minibase</B>: It uses a layered approach, with Record, PageFile, Buffer
Manager, and System layers.  An error in one layer will propogate up 
to the higher layers.

<H2>Current Error Convention</H2>
<B>Carey-minirel & Minibase</B>: A layered approach was needed, but since the possibility
exists of different groups calling each other (DB->BufMgr->DSM), the path
that error discovery may take is slightly confusing.  A global error class
will log errors as they go.  Each layer (when an error is discovered)
will enter an error into a linked list of error msgs, allowing the user
to see where the error was first discovered and see how the error
caused various functions to fail.
<BR>
The <I>Status</I> enumerated type is still used, and care must be taken
that different groups recognize that not all Status types are actual errors.
In some cases, Status is used to signal a condition.  In these instances, the 
different groups must be aware of the types used so that the proper
interpretation is made.
