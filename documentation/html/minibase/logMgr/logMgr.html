The Logging Protocol for Minibase is based on ARIES.  It uses 
WAL (write-ahead logging), 
and it supports the use of the Steal/No-force policy by the Buffer Manager.

The Log Manager does a physical logging of all changes to the database.
It has no knowledge of log record types and merely interprets log records
as sequences of bytes. It primarily interacts with the Recovery Manager.
<p>
The log record is maintained as a UNIX file. All updates are performed 
through the Recovery Manager into the log tail.  
Writes to the log are sequential. The log tail is stored in shared memory,
and is a derived class of the base SharedRegion class i.e. a semaphore
guards access to the log tail. 
<p>
The Log Manager defines
the structure of the log sequence number (LSN). Every log record has a 
distinct LSN. In the case of Minibase, the LSN is merely the offset from
the beginning of the log.  The value of the LSN is assigned by the 
Recovery Manager.
