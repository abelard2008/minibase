<P>
The current implementation uses a single page for the log tail and
locks the entire shared memory structure while performing any
operation.  This considerably reduces concurrency.  Since log record
writes are in the critical path of every update (i.e., every update
operation has to log its update), maximizing concurrency is crucial.
<P>
	This section outlines an alternate, more complex design for
the log manager that considerably increases the concurrency.
<P>
	Concurrency can be enhanced if we reduce the size of
the critical section to encompass just the assigning of LSNs.  Writing
on the log tail page can proceed concurrently because the writes are
to non-overlapping portions of the page (the mutual exclusion of
assignment of LSNs guarantees this).  The scheme is more complicated
because we no longer know when a page can be flushed.  Also, since LSN
assignments proceed at a faster rate, we have to ensure that the page
for a log write is in the log tail before allowing the write to
proceed.  This raises the question of what should be done if the page
is not in the log tail.
<P>
	We propose the following solution to tackle these problems.
We assume double buffering, i.e., two log tail pages such that when
one is being flushed to disk, the other can be filled by log writes.
Associated with each log tail page is the page ID in the log file it
corresponds to.  Each page ID is protected by a semaphore.  We denote
the page ID corresponding to log tail page <i> p</i> as <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img25.gif"></i> and
the semaphore as <i> sp<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img26.gif"></i>.  Figure <A HREF="node25.html#figurenewdesign">3</A>
illustrates the configuration.

<BR><STRONG>Figure 3:</STRONG> The design for enhancing concurrency.  Each page in the log
tail has the page ID of the log file that it corresponds to.  Each
page ID is protected by a semaphore.  <i> wait<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img30.gif"></i> is the list of
processes (transactions) waiting for the page ID, <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img31.gif"></i>, to
change.  <i> write<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img32.gif"></i> is the list of transactions that have been
assigned LSNs for page <i> p</i> but not yet written their records.<BR>
<P>
<P>
	Let us walk through a typical set of log writes.  Initially,
both buffers are empty.  <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img34.gif"></i> is 0, <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img35.gif"></i> is 1.  Every
log write goes through a critical section for assignment of LSN.  Let
the first five log records get LSNs assigned in page 0.  All five of
these can now concurrently write to page 0.  Every time an LSN is
assigned for a log write to page <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img36.gif"></i>, an entry is made in
<i> write<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img37.gif"></i>.  When the corresponding <tt> memcpy</tt> to the log tail
succeeds, the entry is removed.
<P>
	When the sixth log write request arrives, the LSN assignment
code detects that a page change has occurred<A NAME=tex2html8 HREF="footnode.html#348"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/latex2html//foot_motif.gif"></A>.  Thus, no more log writes to page
<i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img38.gif"></i> occurs.  This is made note of.  Now, when <i> write<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img39.gif"></i>
becomes empty, the flusher can be invoked.
<P>
	The flusher will check whether another flusher is active for
page <i> q</i>.  If so, it waits until that flush completes.  It will
then start writing the page to disk.  Since <i> write<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img40.gif"></i> is empty,
it is guaranteed that no further updates to page <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img41.gif"></i> will be
made.  (Flushers can check whether other flushers are active by having
semaphores per log tail page that are <i> down</i>ed and <i> up</i>ed by
the flushers only.)
<P>
	Meanwhile, LSN assignments and log writes will continue in the
page <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img42.gif"></i>.  Suppose that log writes to page <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img43.gif"></i> are
completed.  No further log writes can occur because the page <i>
ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img44.gif"></i> is still being flushed.  This is detected by writers because
<i> LSN.pageID <IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img45.gif"> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img46.gif"></i><A NAME=tex2html9 HREF="footnode.html#410"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/latex2html//foot_motif.gif"></A>.  When a transaction detects this, it adds
itself to <i> wait<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img49.gif"></i> and goes to sleep.  (Because of double
buffering, each transaction will know which buffer it will write to
eventually.)
<P>
	When the flusher is done with page <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img50.gif"></i>, it will <i>
down(sp<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img51.gif">)</i>, update <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img52.gif"></i> and <i> up(sp<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img53.gif">)</i>.  Finally, it
will wake up all processes in <i> wait<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img54.gif"></i>.  These transactions will
again check <i> LSN.pageID</i> against <i> ID<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE ALT="" SRC="img55.gif"></i> before proceeding
with the log write.
<P>
	Not much can be gained by increasing the number of buffers,
because, finally, a new buffer can be written to only after it has
been flushed.  Double buffering with the above strategy is likely to
give good concurrency.
