<P>
<A NAME=subsubsectionimpllogopen>&#160;</A>
<P>
The open constructor will open the log file, attach to the shared
memory structure, and initialize data members so that the log is
operational.  Each <em> Minirel</em> process will have an object of <tt>
class log</tt> in private memory.  The shared memory is accessed through
<tt> global_shm_log_ptr</tt>.  The following paragraphs describe the
sequence of operations that the open constructor goes through.
<P>
	The open constructor must mutually exclude other opens from
occurring concurrently.  If the opens of the first two transactions
access the shared memory structures without mutual exclusion, each
open may think that it was the first one and a race condition will
occur.  To prevent this, the open constructor <tt> down</tt>s the <tt>
sl_sem</tt> semaphore before attempting anything else.  Thus, <tt>
sl_sem</tt> is used to mutually exclude opens from each other.
<P>
	However, it may be argued that the internal semaphore that
each shared memory segment has (by virtue of deriving from <tt> class
SharedRegion</tt>) can be used for mutual exclusion.  This semaphore is
used by all methods to mutually exclude access to the shared memory
structure.  Unfortunately, this will not work for the open
constructors of the first set of transactions if they all start their
opens more or less simultaneously.  Consider the following code
fragment:
<P>
<PRE>    global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;lock();            //  down the semaphore
    if (global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;sl_n_xact &gt; 0) {
        global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;sl_n_xact++;
        global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;unlock();
        return;
    }
    global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;sl_n_xact = 1;

    //
    //  We are the first transaction.  Initialize shared memory
    //  structures.  Fill in the information by reading the header
    //  page from the log file.  Call recovery manager to perform
    //  restart.
    //
    ...
</PRE>
This segment will not work because the recovery manager will attempt
to read the log.  <tt> Log::read</tt> will try to down the semaphore again
and will block everyone forever.  We have to unlock before calling
recovery.
<P>
	However, if we unlock before recovery, it could happen that
some other transaction enters its open, detects that it is not the
first, increments <tt> sl_n_xact</tt>, does not perform recovery, and
starts reading and writing the log.  Unfortunately, since recovery has
not run yet, the log will be corrupted if another transaction attempts
to read and write it.
<P>
	It may appear that the second transaction went along
corrupting the log because it saw that <tt> sl_n_xact</tt> was 1.
However, setting <tt> sl_n_xact</tt> to 1 finally (instead of at the
start) is not a correct solution.  If this were done, the second
transaction will also think that it is the first one in the system and
perform restart recovery.  There will be two restarts running
concurrently.  Since the recovery manager assumes that at most one
copy of it is running in restart recovery mode at any time, this
solution is incorrect.
<P>
	The correct solution is that we must mutually exclude opens
from each other.  In that case, no other transaction can open the log
while another transaction is attempting an open.  Also, the first
transaction gets to run restart recovery without the danger of another
transaction doing the same.  Further, since we do a <tt>
global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;unlock()</tt> before restart recovery, the recovery
manager can safely issue <tt> log::read</tt> and <tt> log::write</tt> calls.
No other transaction will simultaneously be trying to execute <tt>
global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;lock()</tt> because it is guaranteed that only the
first transaction will run recovery.  <tt> Down</tt>ing <tt> sl_sem</tt>
prevents other transactions from entering the system.
<P>
	The following argument demonstrates that there is no deadlock:
<P>
<UL><LI> Every open will start by <tt> down</tt>ing
the <tt> sl_sem</tt> semaphore.  If at any time, it accesses a shared
memory structure, it will also perform a <tt>
global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;lock()</tt>.  Thus, shared data structures are not
corrupted.
<P>
	<LI> Other <tt> log</tt> methods never use <tt> sl_sem</tt>.
<P>
	<LI> Every open requests a <tt> down</tt> on <tt> sl_sem</tt> before
a <tt> global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;lock()</tt>.
<P>
</UL>
Thus, every open requests the <tt> down</tt>s in the same order and other
methods never <tt> down</tt> <tt> sl_sem</tt>.  Therefore, there can never be
a deadlock.
<P>
	Since every method <tt> up</tt>s semaphores that it <tt> down</tt>s
and there is no deadlock, there is no possibility of starvation.
<P>
	Initialization of shared memory structures, etc., is
straightforward.  It will not be described here.
<P>
	There is one further problem that must be resolved.  The <tt>
main()</tt> function of a <em> Minirel</em> process instantiates a global
object of <tt> class log</tt> by executing:
<P>
<PRE>            extern log *logMgr;
            char        log_file_pathname[MAXPATHNAME];
            Status      error_status;

            logMgr = new log(log_file_pathname, error_status);
</PRE>
<P>
Therefore, <tt> logMgr</tt> has not been initialized when the open
constructor is in progress.  However, the open constructor, on
detecting that it is the first transaction to use the database, will
start restart recovery.  Restart recovery will then read log records
by invoking:
<P>
<PRE>            logMgr-&gt;read(...);
</PRE>
This will fail because <tt> logMgr</tt> has not been initialized as yet.
The solution we adopted was to execute
<PRE>            logMgr = this;
</PRE>
in the open constructor code just before calling restart recovery.
