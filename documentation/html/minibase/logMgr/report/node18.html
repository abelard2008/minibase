The <tt> write</tt> method first checks if the log record supplied is
beyond the maximum size allowed.  If not, it executes <tt>
global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;lock()</tt> because it extensively accesses and
modifies the shared memory structure.  It then computes the total
number of pages that the log record would need<A NAME=tex2html6 HREF="footnode.html#314"><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="gif" SRC="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/latex2html//foot_motif.gif"></A> and the number of pages available in the
log.  The current size of the log is defined as the number of pages
between the first LSN (<tt> global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;sl_firstlan</tt>) and
the current last LSN (<tt> global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;sl_nextlsn</tt>)
inclusive.  For normal log writes [those writes that do not correspond
to transaction aborts (CLRs)] a check is made to verify that writing
the log record will not cause the log size to exceed half its maximum
size.  For CLRs, a check if made against the maximum size of the log.
That way, if a transaction decides to abort, there will be enough
log space to write out all the CLRs.
<P>
	If the check for log size fails, the recovery manager is
called to compute a more optimistic value of first LSN and the check
is repeated.  If it fails this time, the log write is failed.
<P>
	It is now known that the log record will fit into the log.
Therefore, it is assigned an LSN.  The LSN of the log record is the
current value of <tt> global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;sl_nextlsn</tt>.
<P>
	Normally, a small log record will fit into the log tail.  This
is the simplest case.  The log record is copied into the log tail and
the last LSN is updated.  If the log record is too big to fit a page,
then whatever fits is copied into the log tail, the log tail is
flushed, and the remaining portion is written in a similar manner.
Thus, the <tt> write</tt> method will work for log records that span many
pages.
<P>
	Unfortunately, the procedure outlined above is not foolproof.
Suppose a log record spans more than a page.  Assume that the first
write and flush succeeded.  Suppose that during the second write, a
power failure occurred.  Now the log is left inconsistent.  During
restart, the end of log will not be detected properly (see
Section <A HREF="node19.html#subsubsectionimpllogread">5.4.6</A>) and the <tt> read</tt> may
return incorrect data.  One way of detecting corruption is to end
every log record with a magic number.  If we do not detect the magic
number at the end of the record read, we know for sure that the
corresponding <tt> write</tt> failed midway.  However, if we do detect the
magic number, we still cannot be sure that there was no corruption.
Hence, using this method of detecting corruption is not guaranteed
to work.
<P>
	When the entire log record is written, <tt> write</tt> executes
<tt> global_shm_log_ptr-&gt;unlock()</tt> and returns.  The log record
that was supplied as a parameter to <tt> write</tt> will now contain the
LSN field filled in.
