<em> Minirel</em> is a simple, multi-user RDBMS.  It has all the features
of a regular RDBMS, including concurrency control and locking, logging
and recovery, buffer, heap file, and space management, access methods
(B<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img14.gif">-trees, hashing, grid files, etc.), relational operators, query
planning, and user interface components.  The log manager fits into
the system as follows:
<P>
<UL><LI> Every update operation will log its update via the
recovery manager into the log tail.  When the log tail is full or when
there is a flush request, the log tail is flushed to disk.
<P>
	<LI> WAL is enforced by informing the buffer manager whenever
the log tail is flushed.  The buffer manager can also call the log
manager to flush the log tail when it wants to flush a page whose page
LSN is more than the last flushed LSN the buffer manager knows about.
<P>
	<LI> The recovery manager periodically writes checkpoint
records into the log and calls the log manager to update the master
log record.
<P>
	<LI> On restart, the recovery manager scans the log and
performs restart recovery as described in
Section <A HREF="node2.html#sectionariesintro">2</A>.
<P>
</UL>
Thus, the log manager mainly interacts with the recovery manager.
Every other component (except the buffer manager) sees the log manager
only through the recovery manager.   The only
piece of the log manager that the buffer manager sees is the
enforcement of the WAL protocol.
<P>
	<em> Minirel</em> is organized as follows: every <em> Minirel</em>
process runs one transaction and accesses one database throughout its
existence.  There is one log corresponding to each database.  (For
simplicity, the log is maintained as a Unix file.  Duplex-disks and
log disks are not used.)  Every <em> Minirel</em> process has the entire
code for all components.  However, the data portion (the buffer pool,
the log tail, the lock and transaction tables, etc.) are kept in
shared memory.  The first transaction to use a database initializes
all the shared data structures.  Currently, a <em> Minirel</em> process
uses only one database and its corresponding log.  Thus, the shared
memory data structures correspond to a common database.
<P>
	We have made the following simplifications:
<P>
<UL><LI> No duplex-disks or raw device manipulation.  We maintain
the log as a single Unix file.
<P>
	<LI> A log tail of size one page.  This considerably
simplifies the implementation.  Unfortunately, performance is not as
good as it would have been with double buffering or multiple buffers.
<P>
	<LI> Complete ignorance of log record types.  All that the
log manager sees is a sequence of bytes.  The recovery manager
interprets the contents of a log record.
<P>
	<LI> No transaction ``crashes.''  If regular crashes
were allowed and a transaction was in a critical section when it
crashed (e.g., updating the log tail), no other transaction can enter
its critical section.  Thus, every transaction exits cleanly.
However, cleanliness is restricted to unlocking shared data structures
and exiting critical sections.
<P>
</UL>
The log management component of a real database system would relax
these assumptions and be more rigorous about duplexing and crashes.
