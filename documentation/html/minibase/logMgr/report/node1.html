The recovery subsystem is an essential part of any Relational Database
Management System (RDBMS).  Functions that are performed by the
recovery subsystem include:
<P>
<OL><LI> <A NAME=introenumlogging>&#160;</A> Logging of all updates done
to the database.  Either physical changes to the database may be
logged (<em>physical logging</em>, e.g., the bytes in the offset range
20--24 in page 3 of the database changed from &lt20, 30, 40, 50,
60&gt to &lt75, 32, 47, 95, 126&gt) or the
operations performed on the data may be logged (<em>logical logging</em>,
e.g., an insert of the &lt<em>key</em>, <em>record-id</em>&gt
pair &lt25, 65&gt was done on the B<IMG  ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="img13.gif">-tree index on
employee ID of relation foo of the database).
<P>
	<LI> Supporting the notion of transaction <em> aborts</em> or
<em> rollbacks</em>.  Every change that the transaction effected on the
database must be undone.  The log of changes made by the transaction
to the database (maintained, as described in
(<A HREF="node1.html#introenumlogging">1</A>) above) is used for this purpose.
<P>
	<LI> Crash recovery.  The data in the database must be
protected against crashes.  Modern RDBMSs use a buffer pool to cache
the most often/recently used pages of the database.  If the system
crashes before the changes made in main memory make it to disk, the
recovery subsystem, on restart, will have to reconstruct the changes.
Again, the log is consulted to determine the changes effected.  Also,
transactions that were in progress at the time of the crash need to be
undone.
<P>
	<LI> Checkpointing and Savepointing.  Checkpointing takes a
snapshot of certain key data structures and stores it in the log.
This checkpoint is used during restart to minimize the amount of work
the system needs to do before everything is back to normal.
Savepointing allows transactions to snapshot themselves at various
points within themselves, and rollback to any previously made
savepoint.

	It is clear that logging is an integral part of the recovery
subsystem.  This project report describes the design and
implementation of a log manager for a recovery subsystem based on
ARIES [<A HREF="node32.html#aries">Mohan et al. 92</A>].  The recovery subsystem is a part of a simple,
multi-user RDBMS called <em> Minirel</em>.
<P>
	Section <A HREF="node2.html#sectionariesintro">2</A> briefly describes how ARIES
recovery works.  This section also introduces the features expected of
a log manager based on ARIES.  Section <A HREF="node3.html#sectionminirelintro">3</A>
describes <em> Minirel</em> and how an ARIES-based log manager fits into
it.  Section <A HREF="node4.html#sectioninterface">4</A> defines the interface that our
log manager provides to other parts of <em> Minirel</em>.
Section <A HREF="node9.html#sectionimplementation">5</A> outlines how the log manager
implements the interface and other implementation issues.
Sections <A HREF="node23.html#sectionfuturework">7</A>
and <A HREF="node26.html#sectionminirelenhancements">8</A> enumerate some additional work
that can be done to enhance the utility and performance of our log
manager and <em> Minirel</em> as a whole, respectively.  Finally,
Section <A HREF="node31.html#sectionconclusions">9</A> concludes the report.
