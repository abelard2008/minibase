As and when a class was implemented, unit testing was done on it to
determine whether its methods worked in isolation.  Then, the classes
implemented so far were integrated and integration testing was
performed to ensure that the classes worked together.  Each time a bug
was found and a fix applied, regression testing was done with previous
test cases to ensure that the bug fix did not break any other part of
the code.  Finally, after the whole log manager was put together, we
wrote a test driver to test the entire code.  The recovery manager and
the buffer manager calls were faked so that a problem could not be the
result of code that we did not develop.  We had the additional benefit
that we started from scratch and did not have to use any existing code
base.  The test cases developed for this driver exercised most paths
of the log manager implementation including several special cases and
boundary conditions.  Quite a few problems were exposed and fixed.
<P>
	Unfortunately, space constraints prevent us from describing
the various test cases.
