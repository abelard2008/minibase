The Recovery Manager of MINIREL, is based on the ARIES
recovery 
algorithms <A HREF="node9.html#aries">[MHL+90]</A>. Some of the important
features of ARIES are:
<UL><LI> It uses the Write-Ahead-Logging (WAL) protocol.
<LI> The use of the WAL protocol supports the use of the Steal/No-force
policy by the Buffer Manager.
<LI> ARIES <em>repeats history</em>.
</UL>
<P>
The Recovery Manager operates in the <b>Normal Mode</b> during normal database operation
and the <b>Restart Mode</b> during crash restart.
While running in the Normal
Mode, the Recovery Manager  supports transaction atomicity by supporting 
rollback for aborted transactions. It also performs checkpoints to 
assist in recovery from crashes. 
The Restart Mode is invoked by the system after a crash. It is the
task of the Recovery Manager to ensure that the system is brought back to
a consistent state.
There are three distinct phases when
a database system is operating in the Restart Mode. 
The initial phase is the <em>Analysis Phase</em>, in which the Manager processes
the log record from the most recent checkpoint taken. 
The <em>Redo Phase</em> repeats
history : i.e. it performs all logged operations. The final <em>Undo
Phase</em> <em>Undo Phase</em> moves backward from the end of the log and 
removes the
effects of those transactions that had not yet committed at the time of
the crash.
<P>
The Recovery Manager primarily interacts with the Log Manager. One of the 
functions of the Recovery Manager is to generate records to log different
actions ( abort, update, commit ). The Recovery Manager creates the log records
which are written to the log file by the Log Manager. The Recovery Manager
also interacts to a lesser degree with the Buffer Manager and the Transaction
Manager.  It is invoked by the Transaction Manager for transaction rollback.
It requests the Buffer Manager for the Dirty Page list and the Transaction
Manager for the Transaction table.  Section <A HREF="node3.html#secinternal">3</A> describes the relationships in detail.
<P>
The remainder of this report is organized as follows. 
Sections <A HREF="node2.html#secexternal">2</A>
and <A HREF="node3.html#secinternal">3</A> describe the external and internal interfaces.
Sections <A HREF="node6.html#secacc">4</A> and
<A HREF="node7.html#sectesting">5</A>  summarize the accomplishments and testing methods utilized
in this project. Finally Section <A HREF="node8.html#secretro">6</A> is the retrospective on the
design of the MINIREL project.
