<H3>General Description </H3>
<UL>
The general responsiility of our group is to provide a Recovery Manager for
MINIREL. It is based on the ARIES recovery algorithms. We provide methods
with which a transaction may abort and take care of the system 
after a crash. The Recovery Manager also provides methods to write log
records during the normal operating mode. <br>

<p>
The Recovery Manager has a "Rollback" method with which
transactions are aborted. When a transaction aborts, all references of the 
transaction are removed from the data pages and an abort log record  and CLRs
are written to the appropriate log file. 

<p>
During normal operation, the 
Recovery Manager provides methods to log update and commit operations to the
log file. That is, the manager takes care of the format of the update and
commit log records. 

<p> 
The real work of the Recovery Manager is after a crash. The "Restart" rooutines
take care of the three phases : Analysis, Redo and Undo, and restore the
system to a consistent state.

<p> 
The Recovery Manager also takes care of checkpointing. During checkpointing
the dirty page table and transaction tables are written to the log file.
After a crash, the analysis phase starts from the log record of the last
checkpoint.

<H3> Interaction with other groups</H3>
<UL>
<li>The Recovery Manager uses the Log Manager interface to write and read
log records from the log file. We, however determine the format of the log
records to be written to the log file.
<li>We interact with the Buffer Manager in order to acquire the Dirty Page
Table, which is logged during a checkpoint.
<li>The OS group provides us with a method to acquire the Transaction table.
This is again, logged during a checkpoint. We also update the LastLSN field
of the Transaction table.
<li>Finally, we interact with the lock manager. During the restart mode of
operation, the entire database needs to be locked and the locking methods 
are used.
