The project in itself was interesting and very satisfying. We do have
comments and thoughts, and here they are.
We are now in the 'integration' phase of the project. We feel VERY
strongly that we should have implemented both the log and the recovery
managers.  We needed a basic functionality from the Log Manager, where the
log was like a simple file to which we could write to, and read from.
We discovered that the Log Manager group had made assumptions,
some of which, in our eyes, were  unnecessary.
<P>
<UL><LI>
For example, the  Log Manager keeps track of the end of the log file
with the help of their 'MAGIC' value. That is, they can recognize 
EOF when they see it,  but need to perform a scan on the log in order to
find it.  So, when the log is first opened, they require that the
Recovery Manager sit in a loop and find the end of file. It is only
after this action is performed, can a log record be written. This defeats
the idea of a Log Manager providing simple functions to write to and
read from the log.
<LI>
If the master lsn is invalid, it implies that the log file is empty and that
there is no transaction that needs to be recovered. In such a case the
Restart routine performs no actions.  Now, when the Log Manager calls
the <em>GetEarliestLSN() </em> function of the Recovery Manager ( for log
compaction ),
they require
that we return a value '010', which is the physical address of the beginning
of the log.  This is a detail we'd rather not have to know about.
</UL>
<P>
Both the points stated above, makes the Recovery Manager somehow 
'know' the internal layout of the log, and the exact implementation of the
Log Manager.
<P>
Another problem recently discovered is the problem with the logging of
space maps. The  Space Management group caches its own copy of the space
map pages. After recovery, the copy of the space map in the cache of the
Space Manager and the disk may be inconsistent. This is because the
Recovery Manager treats the space map pages as any other data page. 
During the restart phase, the Recovery Manager may modify those pages 
in the buffer pool, and the Space Manager will not know about this.
It will continue working with the incorrect version.
We've found two possible solutions to the problem.
<UL><LI> The Space Manager could modify pages in the buffer pool directly without
caching any pages. This would be the simplest and cleanest solution.
<LI> An alternative would be for the Recovery Manager to modify the
Space Manager's cached copies. This, we think would be a more messy solution,
but faster to implement.
</UL>
<P>
To conclude with, the project has been enjoyable and we've gained some
knowledge on what it takes to build a system.  The group meetings have
been interesting and we learned several coding lessons.
