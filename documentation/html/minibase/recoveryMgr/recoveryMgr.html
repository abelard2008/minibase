<H1>Recovery Manager </H1>

The Recovery Protocol for Minibase is based on ARIES.  It uses WAL (write
ahead logging), and it supports the use of the Steal/No-force policy by 
the Buffer Manager.
<p>
The Recovery Manager ensures durability to the database. It operates in
two modes. It runs in the  Normal Mode during normal database operation
and in the Restart Mode during crash restart.
<p>
While running in the Normal Mode, the Recovery Manager supports
transaction atomicity by supporting rollbacks for aborted transactions.
It also performs checkpoints to assist in recovery from crashes. 
The Restart Mode is invoked by the system after a crash. The Minibase
server always excutes the <i>Restart</i> operation at server startup, so
as to ensure that the system is in a consistent state.

<H2>Design Decisions </H2>

The Recovery Manager provides methods for checkpointing, rollback
and restart. It primarily interacts with the Log Manager. One of 
the functions of the Recovery Manager is to generate records to log 
different actions (abort, update, commit). The Recovery Manager creates
the log records which are written to the log file by the Log Manager. 

<p>
The Recovery Manager also interacts to a lesser degree with the Buffer 
Manager and the Transaction Manager. It is invoked by the Transaction Manager
for transaction rollback. It requests the Buffer Manager for the Dirty 
Page list and the Transaction Manager for the Transaction table.
