<H3>General Description of goals & responsibilities</H3>
<UL>
 <LI>Build a recovery manager with checkpointing, rollbacks, and restart 
 routines.
 <LI>Provide the log manager with a handle on the earliest page lsn required,
 in order to do log compaction.
</UL>


<P>
<H3>Meeting Summaries</H3>
<UL>
 <LI>3/24: Decided on a preliminary version of the interface. Interacted
 with the log manager group about the log manager methods we'd need to invoke.
 <li>3/31: Finalized the public interface. Added a function to determine the
 earliest LSN required from the log. This was required by the log manager
 group, to help them with log compaction.
 <li>4/12: Finalized the interface from the log manager group and the OS
 group. We did not have to make any changes in the public interface of the
 RecoveryManager class.
 <li>4/19: The decision to have a log file per database did not change our
 interface significantly. The Buffer Manager group had to include the
 DB name as a parameter, to the function  that returns the dirty page table.
 So also the Operating Systems group. They too had to include the DB name 
 for the function that returns the Transaction Table.
 An issue remains - on whether or not the FirstLSN is to be written into
 the log record during a checkpoint. We will be discussing this detail and
 make the required changes to our code ( and this html document ), as and when
 they are finalized.
 <li>4/25: The FirstLSN will not be logged during the checkpoint. Also, we
 make the assumption that the log manager will not ask for the FirstLSN during
 or before the restart routine of ARIES.
