<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
The buffer manager reads disk pages into a main memory page as needed.
The collection of main memory pages (called <EM>frames</EM>) 
used by the buffer manager for this
purpose is called the <EM>buffer pool</EM>.  
This is just an array of <B>Page</B> objects.
The buffer manager is used by (the code for)
access methods, heap files, and relational operators
to read / write /allocate / de-allocate pages.  
The Buffer Manager makes calls to the underlying DB class object,
which actually performs these functions 
on disk pages.
<P>
The buffer manager can also show the dirty page table when needed.  This
information is required for checkpointing in multi-user
Minibase (ARIES recovery protocol).
Replacement policies for the buffer manager can be changed easily
at compile time.

<H2>Design Decisions</H2>
A hash table is used to figure out what page frame a given disk page
(i.e., with a given pageId) occupies.  
A buffer descriptor object is associated with every
page frame in the buffer pool.  It contains a dirty bit, the page number,
and LSN information (for recovery purposes).
<P>
When a page is requested, the buffer manager brings it in and pins it.
The buffer manager does <STRONG>not</STRONG> keep track of all the pages that have 
been pinned by a transaction.  It is up to the various  
components (that call the buffer manager)
to make sure that all the pinned pages are subsequently unpinned.
<P>
There are some points to be noted with respect to the Buffer Manager
in multi-user Minibase.  It is created in shared memory since the data
structures associated with it --- the buffer pool and the victim
page list --- need to be shared by multiple processes. As every process
is a transaction in Minibase, the Minibase server instantiates the
Buffer Manager, and subsequently, transactions obtain pointers to it.
<p>
The <i>victim list</i> are present to take care of a
<A HREF="victim.html"><B>not-so-often occurence</B></A>.
The victim list keeps track of pages
that have been removed from the buffer pool and are dirty and waiting to
be written to disk.
