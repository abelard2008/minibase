Users of Minibase will need to set two environment variables:
<P>
   "MINIBASE_ROOT", and "PLATFORM".
<P>
     In csh, this is done with:
<P>
     setenv MINIBASE_ROOT /usr/local/minibase<BR>
     setenv PLATFORM `$MINIBASE_ROOT/bin/sysname` <BR>
<P>
  Where '/usr/local/minibase' is replaced by the path to the
  root directory where Minibase is installed locally.
  These lines should be added in one of your startup files,
  for example, '.cshrc' for csh users.
<P>
  Users should also add "$MINIBASE_ROOT/bin" to their search
  path. This is usually done by modifying the 'path' variable.
  For csh users the line:
<P>
    set path = ( $path $MINIBASE_ROOT/bin )
<P>
  will add the directory to the end of your search path.
