<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p>
B+ Trees are one of the <A HREF= "../AM/am.html">access methods</A> that
are available in Minibase.

<H2>Design Decisions</H2>
A few assumptions are made with respect to inserts and deletes in
B+ Trees. <p>

On inserts,when a page becomes full it is split in such a way as to keep
the resulting pages about half full, subject to the condition
that all duplicates remain on the same page.  (Two key/rid pairs
are `duplicates' if they have the same key value.)  In Minibase,
we assume that there will never be more than a page full of
index entries with the same key value.
<P>
Index entries are deleted without any attempt to merge pages
that become less than half-full.  
Pages are de-allocated when they become empty.
(Thus, only a simplified form of the B+ tree deletion algorithm
is implemented.)

<P>
The <B>BTreeFile</B> class is derived from <B>IndexFile</B>,
and scans are objects of the <B>BTreeFileScan</B> class.
Pages are <B>BTreePage</B> objects.  Lower levels (e.g. the Disk
Space Manager) treat pages as <B>Page</B> objects; casting
is used to obtain <B>BTreePage</B> objects.
