<H1>Minibase To Do Page - Grossly Outdated..</H1>

<H2>General</H2>
<UL>
 <LI>Check and make sure that the AM pages are all bigger than 
	the DATASIZE of a page - recsize
 <LI>On entering values (utility functions) "5" with a space after it is not the same as "5".  
      Need to fix the type checking & atoi algorithm.
 <LI>Prompt the user for the working directory.  This is where all the
   databases will be. <B>Problem solved differently</B>
 <LI>Doing joins on empty relations can crash:<BR>
     <I>select emp.ename, dept.dname<BR>
     from emp, dept<BR>
     where emp.ename = "John" and emp.did = dept.did;<BR></I>
 <LI>The answer tuple's fields do not always correspond to the query:<BR>
     <I>select e.did, d.dname<BR>
     from Emp e, Dept d<BR>
     where e.did = d.did;<BR></I>
     <B>{toy, 3}</B>
 <LI>Buffer Manager Free Page should NOT put page on free list
 before checking pin count.
 <LI>Change linearHash Tests gen_rec back to the original one.
     Don't think that I was crazy by using the very simple one, but
     I was having all sorts of purify errors and I was getting
     desperate.  Then the errors all fixed themselves, so we can go back.
 <LI>Use LinearHashingFile::destroyFile(void) as the basis for scanning the entire
     Linear Hash index.
</UL>

<H2>Catalogs</H2>
<UL>
 <LI>create.C = Line 72 = checking tuple size doesn't really work
 <LI>Catalog info is stored as tuples.  But all the work in the
      catalog calls is done as structs.  This is not a problem, but
      if we had known more about the final product, we might have
      rewritten things to make it a little clearer.
 <LI>Load doesn't work yet (should be a very minor change)
</UL>
