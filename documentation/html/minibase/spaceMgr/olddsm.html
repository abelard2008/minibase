<H1>Disk Space manager </H1>

<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<P>
The disk space manager is the component of the system that takes care
of the allocation and de-allocation of  pages among the different files
of a database.  It also performs reads and writes of pages to and from
disk.  In Minibase, a  database is  implemented as a single UNIX file. 
It contains several DBMS level <i>files</i>, 
such as heap files, B+ tree files, etc.

<H2> The Database (DB) Class</H2>
The DB  class  provides  the abstraction  of  a  single database 
stored on disk.
It is the shields the rest
of the database from the fact that the database is implemented as
a single UNIX file.  (Of course, the implementation of this layer
suffers from the limitations of the UNIX file system!)
<P>
Thre should be one instance of the DB class
for every database used.
(In Minibase, a transaction is allowed to have at most one
active database, so there is just one instance of this class.)
The operations  on  this  class  include creating and   destroying
databases. Existing databases can be opened and closed. Further, there
are methods  to   retrieve certain characteristic   properties of  the
database, like the number  of pages and page size.  
<P> 
The DB  class
also provides a <strong> file naming service </strong>. This service is implemented
using records  consisting of  file names and  their header page
ids. There  are functions to  insert/delete/access  file entries.

<H2>The Page Class</H2>
The abstraction of a page is provided by the Page class. All higher 
level applications use this Page. A Page contains an LSN and a data part. 
Higher layers can impose their own types of pages on this common structure.

<H2>Space Management</H2>
<EM>(Not relevant to the single-user version of Minibase.)</EM>
<P>
This class is used to provide the shared memory state of the disk space manager.
The idea was that if multiple databases were supported, then one manager
could have several DB and DSM objects.  Since this is not the case, the
Space Manager class is awkward and can possibly be simplified.
A database
has a single space map that keeps track of the usage of the pages. The
space  manager maintains  the space  map  in shared memory and ensures
consistent access to it by different processes.

<p>  The space manager  logs all  changes  to  the space  map  and the
directory of a database. The case of deallocation  of pages is handled
carefully to ensure that the effects of an aborting transaction can be
completely undone. Deallocation    requests by a  transaction  are not
executed immediately.  They are instead  deffered and the page ids are
maintained in a list. Only  when the transaction commits, changes  are
made to the space map to reflect the deallocation.<br> <br>
