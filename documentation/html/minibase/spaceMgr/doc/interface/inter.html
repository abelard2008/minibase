<H2> General Description </H2>


<P> Our group provides  <b> two </b> independent  interfaces.

<H3> Database  (DB) Interface </H3>
The DB  class  provides  the abstraction  of  a  single database.  The
operations    on  this  class  includes     creating  and   destroying
databases. Existing databases can be opened and closed. Further, there
are methods  to   retrieve certain characteristic   properties of  the
database, like the number  of pages and page size.  <br> The DB  class
also provides <b> directory  service </b>. This service is implemented
in terms  of records  consisting of  file names and  their header page
ids. There  are functions to  insert/delete/access  file entries. <br>
<br>

The top level of  the program should create  an instance of this class
for  every database used.

<P> The abstraction of a page is given by the class Page. All higher level applications use this Page. A Page contains LSN and a data part. Higher layers can impose their own types of pages on this common structure.
<br><br>

<H3> HeapFile Interface </H3>
The heapfile  interface    provides the  capability   of  manipulating
heapfiles which   are  unordered sets  of   records.  Heapfiles can be
created   and  destroyed.  Existing   heapfiles   can  be   opened and
closed. Records  can be inserted and  deleted. Each record is uniquely
identified by a record id (RID). A specific record can be retrieved by
giving the record    id.    It also supports  sequential    scans   on
heapfiles.  A scan  object that  is  returned is used  to retrieve all
records starting from  the first record.  Note that any selections can
only be  applied by a higher   layer which uses  this  scan to get all
records.<br> <br>

<H2>  Private Interface </H2>  

The following is a  description of the space  manager interface.  This
is not needed by  any other group. However, if  you are  interested in
knowing how the  space manager really  works, you are welcome  to read
on....

<p> The space manager  is the component of  the system that takes care
of the allocation and deallocation of  pages among the different files
of a database. A  database is a  single UNIX file. It contains several
<i>files</i> , like the heapfiles, B+tree  files and so on. A database
has a single space map that keeps track of the usage of the pages. The
space  manager maintains  the space  map  in shared memory and ensures
consistent access to it by different processes.

<p> The other  function of the space map  is maintaining the directory
for every database. The directory   contains the mapping between  file
names and their header pages. Thus when a file needs to be opened, its
directory entry  can be looked up which  gives us the header page. The
directory is also  maintained in shared  memory  and consistent access
ensured. 

<p>  The space manager  logs all  changes  to  the space  map  and the
directory of a database. The case of deallocation  of pages is handled
carefully to ensure that the effects of an aborting transaction can be
completely undone. Deallocation    requests by a  transaction  are not
executed immediately.  They are instead  deffered and the page ids are
maintained in a list. Only  when the transaction commits, changes  are
made to the space map to reflect the deallocation.<br> <br>
