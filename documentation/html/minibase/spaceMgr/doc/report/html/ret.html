<h1> Retrospective </h1>

Our close  association with this  project from the beginning  of  the
design phase has shown us the difficulty in designing a system of this
kind. We have learned about tradeoffs that need to be made and the near
impossibility of getting  everything right in  the first attempt.  The
following comments express our feelings about the future directions in
which Minirel can evolve and the improvements that can be made. We are
not sure if they are feasible,  or how they  affect other parts of the
system.
<p>
<h2> Limitations and Future Enhancements </h2>

Currently,  there are several restrictions  about the use of databases
within a  process and also  among processes. Support  for several open
databases   in  a transaction might  be  useful.  Also, processes with
different open databases should be permitted to  share the same buffer
pool.
<p>

The  current structure  requires that the   higher layers talk to  the
buffer manager <i>most of the time</i>. However,  they need to call the
DB  methods  for accessing the directory service. It
might be better if  a common interface that  provides all the features
is developed.
<p>

The shared memory implementation handles only allocation of memory but
does  not  support  deallocation. The  users   should write  their own
mechanism for     managing the deallocated space.   In   a system like
Minirel, where several components use shared  memory and are developed
separately,  this  would  lead to a lot of redundancy   of
code. Every  component has its own  free  list implementation and some
components require the maintenance of several lists. It would be nice
if  the shared region class  also supported deallocation  of memory in
some clean way.
<p>

Only   page level locks are   supported.  This severely restricts  the
amount of concurrency  possible.  For instance,  a change to   a single
record on  a heapfile page  causes the  entire  page to be  locked  in
exclusive mode. No other  transaction  can access  this page  till the
previous    one  committed or   aborted.   Having locks with different
granularities and support for a richer variety of locks would aid high
concurrency.
<p>

Byte level logging causes high overhead while logging changes to a few
bits on the space map. We are not aware of any scheme that avoids this
overhead.
<p>

As regards our implementation, there is  some scope for improvement in
the   way inserts on  heapfiles  are  handled. We  are  not sure  that
maintaining  a  list of  pages  with some free space  on  it is a good
solution.  Some better scheme needs to  be developed that ensures that
inserts  are both reasonably  fast  and   make  efficient use  of  the
available space. Also, we have a restriction on  the nature of updates
that are  possible on records. Use  of forwarding pointers can get rid
of this restriction. <p>

During  the recovery phase, the  recovery manager loads the pages into
memory  and    restores  the  <i>before</i> images for   the     aborted
transaction.  This causes a  problem in the case of  space map and the
header  pages. These pages are stored   in shared memory  by the space
manager and  not in the  buffer pool.  Thus  changes  by the  recovery
manager to these  pages do  no get  reflected in the  space manager. A
possible solution is that the recovery manager treats these pages in a
special manner. It can be given access  to the shared memory structure
maintained by the  space  manager and  thus, all the  changes are made
there and not in the buffer pool.  Another possible solution, maybe 
cleaner, but one which would cause substantial redesign, would be to
treat the Space Management information as a part of the buffer pool.
