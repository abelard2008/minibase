<h1>Heapfiles</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

A <i>heapfile</i> is an unordered set of  variable sized records. Each record
is viewed  as a sequence of bytes.  The  heapfile component of Minirel
provides the  ability to create  heapfiles and to open  existing ones.
Records can be inserted to and  deleted from the heapfile. Each record
has  a  unique  record  identifier.  By  specifying the   record id, a
specific   record can be retrieved or    updated in place.  Sequential
scans on    the heapfile are  supported.   Finally,  heapfiles  can be
deleted from the database.
<p>

The heapfile  component uses the  <i>buffer   manager</i> to  read and  write
pages. It also directly accesses the directory  service offered by the
<i>space   manager</i>. The methods  provided  the <i>lock manager</i>  are used for
regulating the  accesses  by concurrent users  of  the heapfile. Crash
recovery is ensured through the  physical logging of updates to  pages,
using the <i>recovery manager</i>.
<p>

<h2>External Interface</h2>

The heapfile  component  exports the  classes  <b>HeapFile</b> and <b>
Scan</b>. 

<h3>Class HeapFile</h3>

<pre>
class HeapFile 
{
friend class Scan;
public:
	HeapFile(char* name,Status& returnStatus); 
        ~HeapFile();                      

        Status insertRecord(char* recPtr, int recLen, 
			    RID& outRid); 
        Status deleteRecord(const RID& rid); 
        Status updateRecord(const RID& rid, char* recPtr, 
			    int reclen);

        int getRecCnt();
        Status getRecord(const RID& rid, char* recPtr, 
			 int& recLen); 
	
        Scan* openScan(Status& status);

        Status deleteFile();
}
</pre>
<p>

The class <i>HeapFile</i> provides the abstraction  of an unordered set
of records. The records are a sequence of bytes and no field structure
is assumed.  The  methods return  a status  that indicates whether the
operation was successful or not (refer global_error).
<p>

The constructor takes the  name as an input  parameter. If  a heapfile
with the name already exists in the database,  it is opened. If not, a
heapfile   is created with   this   name. The  destructor closes   the
heapfile.
<p>

Each record in the heapfile has a unique  identifier of type RID. <tt>
insertRecord()</tt> inserts the specified  record  into the heapfile and
returns  the rid corresponding   to  the record. <tt> deleteRecord()</tt>
takes the record identifier  and deletes the corresponding record from
the  heapfile. If the  specified record identifier does not correspond
to  an  actual  record,   an  error  is   flagged.  The  method   <tt>
updateRecord()</tt> modifies the contents of  the specified record without
changing   its   rid. In the    current   implementation,  there is  a
restriction that the  length of the  new record should not exceed  that
 of the old record.
<p>

<tt> getRecCnt()</tt> returns the  number of  records that are currently
stored in the heapfile. A specific  record can be retrieved by passing
its record   identifier to   <tt> getRecord()</tt>.   <tt> deleteFile()</tt>
removes  the heapfile  from the  database.   A sequential scan of  the
heapfile  can  be initiated   through  <tt>openScan()</tt>.   This method
returns an object   of type <i> Scan</i>, which is   discussed  in  the  next
section.

<h3>Class Scan</h3>

<pre>
class Scan
{
public:
        ~Scan();
        Status getNext(RID& rid, char* recPtr, int& recLen);
}
</pre>
<p>

The <i>Scan</i> class supports  the sequential scan of  a heapfile. No conditions
can be applied  on the scan and thus,  all the records in the heapfile
are retrieved in turn. Objects of this type can only be constructed by
<tt>openScan()</tt>   method  of  the  <i>HeapFile</i>    class and hence,   the
constructor of this class is  not public to  the users of the heapfile
component.
<p>

<tt> getNext()</tt> fetches  the  next record  in the  heapfile.  It also
returns the  record  identifier of  the  retrieved record. This method
returns DONE when there are no more records to be fetched.
<p>

<h2>Internal Design</h2>

The <i>heapfile</i> is essentially a set of pages  in the database on which a
special structure  is imposed.  When a heapfile   is created, a header
page is allocated and  the file entry consisting  of the name  and the
identifier of  the header page is  inserted into the directory using a
method  of the  DB class.  When  the  constructor of  the heapfile  is
invoked, it is  determined whether  the heapfile is  to be  created or
just  opened. This is done by  using the <tt>get_file_entry()</tt> method
of the DB class.  If the entry with the  specified name does not exist
in the directory,  the heapfile is  created. Otherwise it simply opens
the heapfile.
<p>

The header page  of the heapfile is  different from the other pages of
the heapfile.  The  header   page  does  not store  any  records.  The
structure of the header page is as follows.
<p>

<pre>
struct HeaderPage
{
    char        fileName[MAX_NAME];  // name of file
    PageId      firstPage;      // pageNo of first data page
    PageId      lastPage;       // pageNo of last data page
    int         pageCnt;        // number of pages
    int         recCnt;         // record count
};
</pre>
<p>

The <tt>firstPage</tt> and <tt> lastPage</tt> fields are  used in the  method
for inserting records.
<p>

Each of the data  pages of the heapfile share  a common structure. The
class <b>HFPage</b> provides  the abstraction  for  a data page  of the
heapfile.
<p>

<pre>

// slot structure
struct slot_t {
        short   offset;  
        short   length;  // equals -1 if slot is not in use
};

const int DPFIXED= sizeof(lsn_t)+sizeof(slot_t)+4*sizeof(short)+
                   3*sizeof(int);
const int DATASIZE = PAGESIZE - sizeof(lsn_t);

class HFPage {
private:
    char        data[DATASIZE - DPFIXED]; 
    slot_t      slot[1]; // first element of slot array
    short       slotCnt; // number of slots in use;
    short       freePtr; // offset of first free byte in data[]
    short       freeSpace; // number of bytes free in data[]
    short       dummy;  // for alignment purposes
    PageId      prevPage; // backward pointer to data page
    PageId      nextPage; // forward pointer to data page
    PageId      curPage;  // page number of current pointer

public:
    void init(PageId pageNo); // initialize a new page
    void dumpPage(); // dump contents of a page

    PageId getNextPage(); // returns value of nextPage
    PageId getPrevPage(); // returns value of prevPage
    void setNextPage(PageId pageNo); // sets value of nextPage
    void setPrevPage(PageId pageNo); // sets value of prevPage

    // inserts a new record pointed to by recPtr with length 
    // recLen onto the page, returns RID of record 
    Status insertRecord(char* recPtr, int recLen, RID& rid);

    // delete the record with the specified rid
    Status deleteRecord(const RID& rid);

    // returns RID of first record on page
    // returns NORECORDS if page contains no records. 
    // Else, returns OK

    Status firstRecord(RID& firstRid);

    // returns RID of next record on the page 
    // returns ENDOFPAGE if no more records exist on the page
    Status nextRecord (RID curRid, RID& nextRid);

    // copies out record with RID rid into recPtr
    Status getRecord(RID rid, char* recPtr, int& recLen);

    // returns a pointer to the record with RID rid
    Status returnRecord(RID rid, char*& recPtr, int& recLen);
}

<b> Slot Directory Structure </b><br><br>
<IMG SRC = "page.gif">
<br><br><hr>
<p>

The  HFPage  class uses a  <i> slotted page</i> approach for organizing
variable  sized records.   The records  are stored   one after another
starting  at byte 0 of the  page while the  slot array  grows from the
rear of the page towards the  front.  As the  records are deleted, the
resulting hole is compacted.  However, since records are addressed via
a RID (consisting of the <pageNo, slotno> pair), the slot array is not
compacted. Each element of the slot array contains the offset into the
page where the  record starts and its length.   If the slot is  not in
use, the length  field is  set   to -1. The  slots  in  the array  are
themselves  numbered   as 0,-1,-2 and  so   on.  Thus the  slot number
specified in a    RID has to    be inverted before  indexing into  the
array. slotCnt is used to indicate the current end  of the slot array.
freePtr is the first free byte in  data[] and freeSpace keeps track of
how much  free space  is  available in data[].   dummy is   needed for
alignment.  The nextPage  and prevPage attributes  are used to  form a
<i>doubly linked list</i> of the pages in the heapfile.
<p>

The methods of HFPage provide the primitives for all operations on
a  single page.  <tt>insertRecord()</tt> tries   to  insert the specified
record into the  page. It returns a error  if there is not  sufficient
free space on the    page. <tt>deleteRecord()</tt> deletes   the  specified
record  and compacts  the  hole created.  This  requires that all  the
offsets in the slot array, of all the records to the right of the hole
be adjusted by   the size of  the hole.  <tt>firstRecord()</tt> and  <tt>
nextRecord()</tt> are  used  to fetch  records  off  a  page.  The <tt>
getRecord()</tt> method copies out the   specified record, while the <tt>
returnRecord()</tt> method returns a   pointer to the record.  The  latter
function is used by the <tt>updateRecord</tt> method of HeapFile.
<p>

The   methods in  the HeapFile class    invoke suitable methods of the
HFPage class. <tt>insertRecord</tt>  first determines the page  where the
record insertion is attempted. In the current implementation, the last
page of the  heapfile is the  only page  considered  for insertion. If
there is not enough space on the last page, a  new page is created and
the record inserted there. An alternative implementation could involve
maintaining   a  list of     pages  that have  some   free   space  in
them.  However, due to  variable  sized  records, this strategy  might
degenerate to an entire scan on insert, in the worst case.
<p>

<tt>deleteRecord()</tt> simply calls the function with the same name on the
appropriate data page. <tt>updateRecord()</tt>  first obtains a pointer  to
the   record   on the page  and    then modifies   its  contents. <tt>
deleteFile()</tt> deallocates the pages  belonging to the heapfile  and also
deletes the file entry from the directory.
<p>

<tt>openScan()</tt> returns  a Scan object. The  Scan class maintains the
RID of the last  record that has been  returned by it.  Thus a call to
<tt>getNext()</tt> searches for the record following  the current rid and
returns it. If no  such record is  found  i.e. the last record  on the
last page has already been returned, the scan is done.
<p>

The page level  locking primitives  provided by  the lock manager  are
used for concurrency control.  A page that is   read is locked in  the
shared mode and  any that is modified is  locked in exclusive mode.  A
finer granularity  of locking could have  improved  the concurrency of
operations on the heapfile immensely.
<p>


Updates to pages belonging to the heapfile are logged using the method
provided by the recovery   manager. Physical logging is  performed and
the before and after  images of the affected portions  of the page are
logged.
