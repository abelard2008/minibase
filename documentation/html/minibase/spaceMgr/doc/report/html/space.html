<h1> Disk Space Management </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

The <i>space manager</i> is the lowermost layer of Minirel. It performs basic
input and output    operations and    manages the    allocation    and
deallocation of space in the database.
<p>

In Minirel, a database is simply a single UNIX file. The space manager
allows the users to create new databases and to open existing ones. It
supports allocation    and  deallocation of runs   of   pages. It also
provides <i>directory  service</i>.  The  directory  consists of   file
entries which   are  records of  file  names  and   their header  page
identifiers. The  space manager allows  insertion, deletion and access
to file entries.
<p>

The buffer manager is the  layer on top of the space manager. It uses the
space manager for loading pages into the buffer pool and flushing them
to disk. Further,  the storage and access  methods components also use
the directory service for  registering the header  pages of the  files
that  they   create and use.   Examples   of such  components are <i>
heapfiles</i> and <i>B-Trees</i>.  The  space manager uses the  primitives
provided by   the OS   infrastructure component  for  managing  shared
memory.   It  uses     the   lock manager     for  concurrency
control.  Further, it interacts  with the recovery manager for writing
log records.
<p>

<h2>External Interface</h2>

The  space manager exports  the classes  <b>DB</b>  and <b>Page</b>.
<p>

A description of the methods in the public interface follows.

<h3>Class Page</h3>
<pre>
class Page
{
private:
        char data[PAGESIZE - sizeof(lsn_t)];
        lsn_t page_lsn;

public:
        lsn_t get_page_lsn();
        Status set_page_lsn(lsn_t pagelsn);
}
</pre>
<p>

The  Page  class provides   the    abstraction  of  a  page  of    the
database. This class is  used by all the higher  layers that deal with
pages. A  page contains  a LSN and  a data  portion. The higher layers
superimpose their  notion of  a page  on   this common structure.  The
methods  <tt>  get_page_lsn()</tt> and <tt>set_page_lsn()</tt> are used 
for accessing the LSN portion of the page.


<h3>Class DB</h3>
<pre>
class DB
{
public:
        // Constructors
        DB(const char* name,int num_pages, Status& status);
        DB(const char* name, Status& status);

        // Destructors
        ~DB();
        Status db_destroy();

        // Database characteristics
        const char* db_name() const;
        int db_num_pages() const;
        int db_page_size() const;

        // Allocation and deallocation
        Status allocate_page(PageId& start_page_num,int run_size=1);
        Status deallocate_page(PageId start_page_num,int run_size=1);

        // Directory service
        Status add_file_entry(const char* fname, 
			      PageId start_page_num);
        Status delete_file_entry(const char* fname);
        Status get_file_entry(const char* name, 
			      PageId& start_pg);

        // Input and output
        Status read_page(PageId pageno, Page* pageptr);
        Status write_page(PageId pageno, Page* pageptr);

        // Actions at transaction commit or abort 
        Status db_release();
        Status flush_list();

}
</pre>
<p>

The  DB   class provides  the abstraction of   a   single database.  A
database can be  viewed as a set  of pages each of  which has a unique
identifier. Most of the methods return a status to indicate the result
of   the  method.  OK indicates  success    while  DBMGR indicates  an
error. The actual  reason for the error is  registered with the global
error object (refer global_error).  The  first form of the constructor
creates a database with the specified number of pages and the specified
name. The size of each page is a  predefined constant. The second form
of the constructor opens  an existing database. The destructor  closes
the database  and  it can   be  opened again  later. The  method  <tt>
db_destroy()</tt> removes the entire database.
<p>

<tt> db_name(), db_num_pages()</tt> and <tt>db_page_size()</tt> return  
the name, number of pages and the page size of the database.
<p>

<tt>allocate_page()</tt> searches for a run  of free pages in the database
and returns the identifier of  the first page of the  run. This run of
pages  have     now   been  allocated   and    are     not  free. <tt>
deallocate_page()</tt> releases a set  of pages starting at the  specified
page. In both these functions, the run size has a default value of 1.
<p>

The directory  of a database consists of  records each of which have a
name and a page identifier. <tt> add_file_entry()</tt> adds a new record to
the  directory if   a  record with  the   same name  does  not already
exist.   <tt> delete_file_entry()</tt> deletes   the  file entry with  the
specified  name,  if  such   a  record  exists.   The input   to  <tt>
get_file_entry()</tt>  is  a name  and  it   returns  the page  identifier
corresponding to it. These functions are primarily used by the storage
and access methods  to maintain a correspondence between file/relation
names and their header pages.
<p>

The methods  <tt> read_page() and write_page()</tt>  perform the  basic IO
between memory  and disk. <tt>read_page()</tt> reads the contents of the
page specified by its unique  identifier. <tt> write_page()</tt> writes out
the contents of the page to disk.
<p>

Requests to deallocate pages  made by a  transaction do not result in the deallocation 
immediately.  This  is necessary  for   the  recoverability of   these
operations.   The pages to be  deallocated   are buffered by the space
manager and a decision about these  pages is made when the transaction
ends. If the transaction commits, <tt> db_release()</tt>  is called by the
transaction manager and  this method performs  the actual deallocation
of the pages. In case of  an abort, <tt>  flush_list()</tt> is invoked and
the deallocation is not done.
<p>

<h2>Internal Design</h2>

The design of the <i>Page</i> class is straight forward. The algorithms
and the   data structures  involved in  the  design  of  <i>DB</i>  are
discussed in the  following  sections.   Each  section deals  with   a
separate functionality offered by the class.

<h3>Space Management</h3>

The class <i> DSM</i> provides the  support for the management of space
within a database. A set of a few pages of the database are treated as
the <i>space map</i>. The space map is a bitmap,  one bit per page that
indicates whether the page has been allocated or is free. Depending on
the number of pages in the database and the  size of individual pages,
the space map can span several pages.
<p>

Several transactions running as different processes  can have the same
database open at the same time. Thus the space  map of the database is
stored in  shared memory and is  accessed by  all  the processes.  The
shared memory structure is as follows.
<p>

<pre>
typedef struct 
{
        char dbname[MAX_NAME];    // Name of the database
        int pin_count;            // Number of users 
                                  // accessing the spacemap
        int spm_size;             // Size of the space map  
                                  // in pages
        int header_size;          // Number of header pages
        header_page_t header[MAX_HEADER_PAGES];// List of 
					       // header page 
                                               // pointers
        Page space_map[MAX_SPM_PAGES];         // List of Space 
					       // map pages
}DBEntry;               
</pre>
<p>

The fourth  and the fifth  fields in the   structure correspond to the
directory  service   and is discussed  in the   next section. Thus the
complete set of  pages comprising the  space map  is  stored in shared
memory. The first process that opens a database initializes the shared
memory  structure   with  the information   stored   on  disk (or just
initializes it if the database  is being created). Every other process
that opens the database will simply  attach to the same structure. The
accesses to shared memory by multiple processes are synchronized using
the methods provided by the shared memory  manager. Each process locks
the shared memory before accessing  the structure and unlocks it after
it has finished  the access. This is done since  locking  the entire 
shared  memory region is the only primitive available to us, though it
might result in loss of concurrency.
<p>

The <i>pin_count</i>  maintains the count of   the number of  processes
that are currently accessing the database. When this count drops to
zero, the  space map which is  possibly different from the  version on
disk, is written out. Allocation of a run of pages involves inspecting
the bits in the space map and determining if a sequence of consecutive
0s  of the required  length is present.  This  is a rather complicated
algorithm, which  is  typical of  bit-level manipulation.  A further
complication arises  in  determining runs that  span  (space map) page
boundaries. When a run has been detected, a  routine is invoked to set
all these bits to 1. Deallocation of a run  of pages involves the same
routine, but this time the bits are set to 0.
<p>

Since Minirel is  a multiuser system,  there  is need  for locking and
logging in the space manager   component. Accesses  to the space   map
results in locking  the appropriate pages.  All  pages that are  being
changed are  locked in exclusive mode and   the lock is held  till the
transaction commits or aborts. On the other hand, those pages that are
only inspected but not modified are locked in shared mode. All changes
to  the space map are logged.  Since a byte is  the smallest size that
can  be logged, changes  to a few bits  in  the space map  can incur a
significant overhead.
<p>

All pages  that have been deallocated  by a transaction are maintained
in a private list.  Since there is only   one active transaction in  a
Minirel process, a  single  list in private  memory  is sufficient. At
commit time, the list  is traversed and changes  are made to the space
map to reflect the deallocation.  If the transaction aborts, the  list
is simply discarded.

<h3>Directory Service</h3>

The directory  of a database   is maintained in a   set of <i>header
pages</i>. Initially,  a single page  is allocated  for the directory. As
new file  entries are added,  additional header  pages are dynamically
allocated. The structure of each header page looks as follows.
<p>
<pre>
struct header_entry_t {
        int valid;
        char fname[MAX_NAME];
        PageId pagenum;
};

const int num_header_entries = (int)((PAGESIZE-sizeof(lsn_t)-
				     sizeof(int))
                                     /sizeof(header_entry_t));
 
struct header_page_t {
        PageId next_page;
        header_entry_t entry[num_header_entries];
        char dummy[PAGESIZE - sizeof(lsn_t) - sizeof(int) - 
                   num_header_entries*sizeof(header_entry_t)];
        lsn_t lsn;
};
</pre>
<p>

The header pages form a singly linked  list and <tt> next_page</tt> stores
the page identifier of the next header page. There are  a fixed set of
file  entries on each  page. The  field <tt>  dummy</tt> is  necessary for
purposes of  alignment.  Each  file entry consists  of  the name, page
identifier and also a valid field that  indicates whether the entry is
currently  in use. The  first entry in the   directory consists of the
database  name   and  the number  of   pages  in the  database.   This
information is needed when a database is opened.
<p>

The shared memory structure   presented in the previous  section  also
contains all the header  pages of the  database. To add a file  entry,
all the valid  entries are first searched. If  an entry  with the same
name already exists,   the new entry cannot  be  added. Otherwise, the
entry is inserted in some invalid slot. If there  are no invalid slots
in any of the header pages, a new page is allocated and linked in. The
new entry is stored on this page. Deletion of a file entry operates in
a similar fashion.
<p>

Any page  that has  been  modified in the course   of an operation  is
locked in exclusive mode, while those that are only read are locked in
shared  mode.  The  insertion  and  deletion  of   file entries  cause
appropriate log records to be written.
