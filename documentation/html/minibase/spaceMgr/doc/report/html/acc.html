<h1> Accomplishments</h1>

We  implemented   the <i>space  manager</i>   and  the <i>heapfile</i>
components of minirel.  The space   manager comprises of the   classes
</i>DB, DSM  and Page</i>.  These had  to  be implemented from scratch
since the    notion of a database  was   entirely different   from the
previous version of  minirel. The  DB and  DSM classes were  initially
implemented   to support   a  very   general use   of   databases.  In
particular, it supported multiple open  databases within a process and
several different databases being  opened by different processes.  The
change in the  design to permit  only one open  database and only  one
database across all processes resulted  in us going  back to the  code
and removing all   the generality from   it.  Further, the   bit level
manipulations that  are necessary for maintaining  the  space map were
typically hard and   required exhaustive   testing  to ensure    their
correctness.  <p>

The  heapfile component consists of  the  <i>HeapFile, HFPage and Scan
</i> classes. Of these, the HFPage code could  be re-used in large part
from  the earlier version   of minirel.   However, since  the heapfile
itself  is now  built on top  of  totally different interface, most of
HeapFile code had to be  written afresh. An  entire new class Scan was
implemented to support sequential scans.  <p>

The development of the multiuser versions of the  above required us to
modify   some  of  the single  user  code  to    now  deal with shared
memory. Further, locking and logging for concurrency control and crash
recovery ensured    that   we had a    complete   understanding of the
primitives offered, their limitations and  means of obtaining the best
results with them.
