<h1> Testing </h1>

The testing of our code can be viewed  as having </i>two</i> phases. The first
phase consisted  of us running a series  of tests that stress the code
and  test  its   correctness.   In  the second  phase,   other  groups
integrated our code with theirs and ran their own tests.
<p>

The normal operation of the space  manager was tested  by having a set
of tests   that  use every   call in  the  interface.   Then,  several
pathological cases were  explored. We  forced the  space  map to  span
several pages, by having  a large number of pages  and a smaller sized
page. Then, the allocation and  deallocation of runs that span  across
page  boundaries were checked.  Similarly,  the  header page can  also
overflow. By having a small  enough page size  (128 bytes), we  forced
the directory to overflow across several pages and tested the routines
that insert, delete and retrieve file entries.
<p>

The multiuser version   of the space manager   uses shared memory  for
storing the  space map and the  directory, Synchronization of accesses
to shared memory   was tested by designing   one process to  lock  the
shared memory and  sleep for a while. This  caused the other processes
to  block trying to access the  shared  memory. When the first process
woke up and  released  the lock, the  other  process could finish  its
execution.
<p>

The  heapfile component   was   exhaustively tested  by  a   series of
tests. These  use  all  the methods in  the  public  interface to  the
heapfile and in several  different   combinations. We inserted   large
number  of   records  that  caused  the    heapfile to  grow   to many
pages.  Under such   conditions, we tested    the working of  inserts,
deletes, scans and all other operations.
<p>

Our  code has been integrated  with  several other  components and has
been used by them for several weeks.  No major bug has been reported
by any of   them, thus reenforcing  the  reliability of our code.  The
space  management   code   has  been  used     by the  <i>buffer  manager</i>
group. Heapfiles have been used by the <i>catalogs</i> group among others.
