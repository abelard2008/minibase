<H1> Disk Space Manager </H1>
<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<P>

   The <strong>disk space manager (DSM)</strong> (implemented as part
   of the DB class) is 
   the component of Minibase that takes
   care of the allocation and deallocation of pages within a database.
   It also performs reads and writes of pages to and from disk, and
   provides a logical <i>file</i> layer within the context of a
   database management system.

<P>

   A Minibase database is implemented as a single Unix file.  Its
   pages are simply page-sized blocks of bytes within this file.  The
   higher-level structures of a Minibase database, such as heap files
   and B+ tree files, are actually logical files consisting of
   collections of database pages.  In discussing the DSM,
   whenever necessary
   we will refer to page-sized blocks of bytes in the underlying
   Unix file as ``pages'', and pages in higher-level structures
   such as heap files as, for example, ``heap file pages'' in
   order to avoid confusion.

<H2>The Page Class</H2>

   The abstraction of a page is provided by the Page class. All higher
   level applications use this Page class.  In the multi-user version of
   Minibase, a Page contains a log serial number (LSN) and a data
   part; in the single-user version, it only has the data part.
   Higher layers impose their own structure on pages simply by casting
   page pointers to their own record types.  The data part of a page
   is guaranteed to start at the beginning of the block.

<H2> The Database (DB) Class</H2>

   The DB class provides the abstraction of a single database stored
   on disk.  It shields the rest of the software from the fact that
   the database is implemented as a single Unix file.
   It provides methods for allocating additional pages (from the
   underlying Unix file) for use in the database and deallocating
   pages (which may then be re-used in response to subsequent
   allocation requests).  (The DB class actually supports allocation 
   and deallocation of a consecutive run of pages,
   though the higher-level code usually just asks for one page at a time.) 

<P>

   There is one instance of the DB class for every database used.  (In
   Minibase, a transaction is allowed to have at most one active
   database, so there is just one instance of this class.)  The
   operations on this class include creating and destroying databases,
   and, as noted above, allocating and deallocating pages.  Further,
   existing databases can be opened and closed, and there are
   methods to retrieve certain characteristic properties of the
   database, like the number of pages and page size.

<H2>File Directory</H2>

   The DB class also provides a <strong> file naming
   service</strong>, which is used by higher-level code to create
   logical ``files of pages''.  This service is implemented using records
   consisting of file names and their header page ids. There are
   functions to insert, look up, and delete file entries.
   The set of file entries is collectively referred to as the
   <strong>file directory.</strong>

<P>
<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<H2>Space Management</H2>

   The DB class keeps 
   track of allocated space within the database using a fixed
   set of pages called the <strong>space map.</strong>  
   They can be thought of as containing a bit
   map: one bit per database page, with ``0'' denoting that the corresponding
   page is free and ``1'' denoting that it is allocated.

<P>

   The DB class maintains the space map, in addition to its other
   duties, updating it whenever pages are allocated or deallocated.  


<P>
<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<H2>Limitations, or Room for Improvement</H2>

   The current implementation creates fixed-size databases; the space
   map is set when the database is created, and never grows.  This
   limitation would be fairly easy to remedy, either by setting a
   maximum database size (still fixing the size of the space map, but
   allowing the database to grow to fit the maximum number of pages
   representable in the map), or by having the space map be a linked
   list of pages and grow as needed.

<P>
   In multi-user Minibase, the DB class logs all changes to the space
   map and the file directory of a database.  It also locks the pages
   that hold these structures whenever it changes them.  Since these
   structures are global to the whole database, this often limits
   multi-user Minibase to a single writer at a time.
   Unfortunately, any complete remedy to this problem is likely to be
   complicated.

<P>

   Here is an idea for a partial solution that might increase
   concurrency somewhat, while still being easy to implement.  Instead
   of locking the space map pages themselves, lock the pages that are
   being allocated or freed.  Then in the page allocator, treat all
   locked pages as if they were already allocated, even if their bit
   in the space map is clear.  Of course this would require a
   semaphore to single-thread updates to the space map.  This idea
   leaves the locking in place for the file-directory pages, so two
   transactions that both needed to create or delete a logical file
   would still be serialized.  But the more common allocating and
   freeing of pages within already-created logical files would
   <i>not</i> require serialization.
