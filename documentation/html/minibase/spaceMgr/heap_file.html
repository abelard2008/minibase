<h2> Introduction </h2>
A <i>heap file</i> is an unordered set of records.  The following 
operations are supported:  <br>
* Heap files can be created   and  destroyed. <br>
* Existing   heapfiles   can  be   opened and closed.<br>
* Records  can be inserted and  deleted. <br>
* Records are uniquely identified by a record id (rid). A specific 
record can be retrieved by using the record id.    <br>
<P>
Sequential scans on heap files are also supported.  
A scan  object is  created, and get-next calls on this 
object allow us to retrieve all
records starting from  the first record.  
<P>
A <i><B>file scan iterator</B></i>
uses a heap file scan, and calls the
<i>eval</i> function
to apply any desired selections to the retrieved tuples.
<P>
Temporary heap files are supported as well.  These are used for external
sorting.  
<P><I>A word on naming: </I>  The catalog also names files.  It would
be best to have a global naming algorithm.

<H2>Design Decisions</H2>

The main kind of page structure used in the Heap File is 
<B><A HREF="hfpage.public.txt">HFPage</B></A>, and this is viewed as a <B>Page</B>
object by lower-level code.  The HFPage class uses a slotted
page structure with a slot directory that contains 
(slot offset, slot length) pairs.  The page number and slot number
are used together to uniquely identify a record (<B>rid</B>).
When a record is deleted, the space is reclaimed by compacting records
on the page, and the length in the corresponding slot entry is
set to a negative value (indicating that the slot is empty).
<P>
Records are inserted only to the last page of a heapfile;  
no attempt is made to find an empty slot on earlier pages.
Therefore, any deletes will cause fragmentation.  Pages
are maintained in a doubly linked list, and can be de-allocated when
empty.  The heap file layer makes calls to the 
<A HREF="../bufMgr/bufMgr.html">buffer manager</A>.
The only exception is that the directory (file naming) services
of the DB class
<A HREF="../spaceMgr/dsm.html">(disk space management)</A>
are called directly.
<P>
Alignment issues are not considered.  Tuples are stored only as a series
of bytes.  It is up to upper layers to make sense of them.

<i><A HREF="../AM/tuple.html">tuples</A></i>.)
