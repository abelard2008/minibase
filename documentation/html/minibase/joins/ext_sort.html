<P>
Sorting a collection of records on some (search) key is a very useful
operation. 
When the data to be sorted is too large to fit into available main memory, we need to
use an <i> external sorting </i> algorithm. Such algorithms seek to minimize the
number of disk accesses.  
<P>
Minibase supports <i> external merge sort </i>:
<P>
Suppose we have <b>B</b> buffer pages available in memory, and we need to sort a large
file with, say, <b>N</b> pages. There are two passes for the external sort.
<OL>
  <LI> In Pass 0, read in B pages at a time and sort internally to produce ceil(N/B) runs
       of B pages each (except the last run, which may contain fewer pages).
       Runs are held in temporary <A HREF="../spaceMgr/heap_file.html"><B>heap files</B></A>.
  <LI> In Passes i = 1, 2, ..., use B - 1 buffer pages for input, and use the remaining
       page for output; thus you do a B - 1 way merge in each pass.
</OL>
