<H1>Transaction Manager</H1>

<IMG SRC="../pics/hline.gif">
<P>
The Transaction Manager keeps the all-important transaction table in
shared memory and manages it. It manages two principal data structures
which are used by other modules and information about the clients,
which is used by the Minibase server.
<p>
The Transaction manager provides the following: <br>
* Xaction_manager class : Keeps track of all transactions in the system.  <br>
* Xaction class: Contains information about every transaction : The pages
on which the transaction has locks, the minimum and the last LSN of the
transaction, the process id and the validity of the transaction.

<h2>Class Structure and Implementation Details</h2><p>
<h3>The Xaction_manager class  </h3><p>
The transaction manager maintains pertinent information about the transactions
in the system. It also provides methods to abort, commit, sleep and wake-up
a transaction. There is a cap of the number of transactions in the system.
This is defined by a global variable 'MINIBASE_MAX_TRANSACTIONS'. It is a
derived class of the base SharedRegion class, as in a semaphore guards
access to its contents. Only one person can modify the transaction table
at one time. The data structures associated with the transaction manager
are created by the Minibase server and are maintained in shared memory.<br>
<p>
Minibase has a global pointer to the Transaction Manager class. It is
created by the Minibase server at server startup and is destroyed at
server shutdown.
<p>
<pre>class Xaction_manager : public SharedRegion{
public:

	Xaction_manager();
	~Xaction_manager();

	Status  begin();
	/* Is called only by the SystemDefs::init function :: A function
	that takes care of system initialization */

	Status  commit();
	/* Will commit a transaction. This is called by the destructor
	of the SystemDefs class */

	Status  abort();
	/* Aborts a transaction ==> will release all locks on the 
	resources that it holds locks on and will delete the entry 
	from the transaction table */

	Status  sleep();
	Status  wakeup(int xid);

	Status  print();

	int     get_key(int seq);               /* hash function */

	// methods used by other modules..

	Status  GetRecInfo(int xxid,RecInfo &recInfo);
	/* Returns the information required by the recovery manager i.e.
	the minimum and last LSN of the transaction. This required to
	determine if the Undo operation must be performed. For more 
	details about the details of recovery, refer to the home page 
	about the Recovery Manager */
	
	Status  SetRecInfo(int xxid,RecInfo &recInfo);

	Status  GetAllRecInfo(const char *db_name,int &num_entries,
			      int xid[], RecInfo recInfoList[]);
	Status  get_lock_info(trans_lock_info* &lock_info);

	/* Provides information about the locks held by a transaction.
	The Lock Manager requests this information from the
	transaction manager */

private:

	int     _total_xaction;   // total transactions in the system
	int     _current_seq;           //current xaction sequence number;
	int     get_cur_seq();  /* get the current xaction sequence number */
	int     get_total_xaction();    /*return  total number of xactions*/
	Xaction* freelist;      //hold deleted Xaction objects;
	Xaction* _xaction_array[MINIBASE_MAX_TRANSACTIONS];

}</pre>

<p>
<h3>The Xaction class </h3>  <p>
<p>
The _xaction_array of the Xaction_manager class is composed of the 
individual transactions in the system. This is again a derived class of
the base SharedRegion. It should be noted that this is not because 
every individual transaction may be accessed individually ( granularity
of latching is not at the transaction level but at the level of the
transaction table) but because we need a semaphore to make individual 
transactions 'sleep' and 'wakeup'. 
<p>
Other details like the pages on which the transaction has locks on 
and the minimum and last LSNs of the transaction as well as information
like the process id and validity are encapsulated in this class. Methods
are provided to access these private data members.
<p>
<pre>
class Xaction : public SharedRegion {
public:
	Xaction();              //ctor for Xaction object
	~Xaction();             //dtor for Xaction object;
	int     get_pid();              //return process id;
	int     get_xid();              //return private _xid;
	void    sleep();                //put this process to sleep;
	trans_lock_info* get_lock();    //return a lock ptr;
	RecInfo* get_info();            //return a recinfo ptr;
	Xaction* next;
	Status  wakeup();               //wake up this process;

private:
        int     _xid;           //xaction id for this object;
	int     _pid;
        int     _valid;
	trans_lock_info* _lockptr;      //for Lock Manager module
	RecInfo* _infoptr;              //for Recovery Manager module

};</pre>
