<CENTER><B>1. Introduction</B></CENTER></b><p>
<p>
	<p>
Minirel was a single user relational data base developed in the University of
Wisconsin, Madison over the past few years. This semester(Spring 1995), there
is an effort leaded by Professor Mike Carey to develop it into a full fledge
multi-user relational database. More than 30 graduate students have
participated in this project. <p>
<p>
To evolve from single user system to multi user system, a crucial task is the
ability to  do communication between different users and to achieve mutual
exclusion and synchronization for access of shared resources.  In this project,
we set up our goal as:<p>
	<p>
* To provide a set of C++ classes that will encapsulate the shared memory 
resource  required  to  make  Minirel  into  a  multi-user  system. <p>
* To provide the lowest level semaphore facility, locking
  protocol for synchronization and mutual exclusion. <p>
* To provide a base class of  SharedRegion, which will be inherited and 
  instantiated to get objects like buffer manager, lock manager, etc.. <p>
* To provide the infrastructure for managing the table for active
transactions. <p>
<p>
In this report, we will discuss and describe the design and implementation of
operating system facilities we have provided for the development of multi user
Minirel. It includes sections on the user interface, implementation, testing
and discussion.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<CENTER><B>2. Class Functionality and Interface</B></CENTER><p>
	<p>
2.1 <u>Semaphore class  </u><p>
<p>
Semaphore class will be constructed from UNIX system calls. It uses a specific
key to get an array of semaphores from the system, and allocate a small trunk
of shared memory to hold control information  on those semaphores. An array of
bit map is put in this shared memory to keep track of which semaphore is used,
which one is available.  When user requests a new semaphore by declaring a new
Semaphore object, a free semaphore in the pool will be granted, corresponding
bit in the bit map is set, and the user just has the impression that he obtains
a new semaphore.<p>

<pre>class Semaphore{

Semaphore(int init=1, int flag = 0); constructor bin-semaphore if flag=0,
			             else general sem default is bin-sem 
				     with init_val 1

void 	operator delete(void *p);    To delete semaphore object. 

int 	up();			     Semaphore value + 1, 
				     for bin-sem, is unlock

int  	down(); 		     sem value - 1,  for bin-sem, is lock 

void    remove();	   	     return to system when not needed anymore
}</pre>

<p>
<p>
<p>
2.2 <u>SaredRegion class </u>  <p>
<p>
SharedRegion is a base class, it will be the parent of all other classes which
will be put in the shared memory and shared by all the users, some examples for
children class are BufferMgr, lock_Mgr, etc. <p>
<p>
It has two public functions:  <i>void lock()</i>, which lock the shared region,
so other process can't get in while one process hold  the lock.  <i>void
unlock()</i>, which unlock the shared region, and let others in.<p>
<p>
<pre>
class SharedRegion {
	void 	lock(); 			Enter, set semaphore
	
	void 	unlock(); 			Leave_normally
};</pre>
<p>
<p>
2.3 <u>SharedMemory class</u> <p>
<p>
An object of this class is a chunk of fixed-size shared memory in the main
memory with other book-keeping information. Different users can communicate
with each other by using this shared memory. All the shared objects like
lock_table, xact_table, and buf_pool will be put into the shared memory.<p>
<p>
The constructor of this class will get a chunk of shared memory by using a
specific key known as SHM_KEY, and then map this shared memory into the calling
process's address space.  Since the key is the same for all users of the db
system, it will guarantee that different process will access the same chuck of
shared memory.  The shared memory will be mapped to the address spaces for all
calling process. It will also check if it is the first calling process. If yes,
it will get  a new shared memory and do mapping, otherwise, only do mapping.<p>
<p>
<pre>
class SharedMemory{
	
	SharedMemory(int size);     In kilobytes 
	
	char* begin_shmadd(); 	    The beginning address of shm
	
	char* malloc(int size);	    Size in bytes get bytes  and return                                             the start address
	
	void 	lock();  	    Lock shm, needed at startup to avoid 
				    race condition,i.e. only one process 
				    do the initialization

	void 	unlock(); 	    Unlock the shm
}</pre>
<p>
<p><p>
2.4 <u>ShMemMgr class</u><p>
<p>
This class manages the shared memory, it first creates an object of the
SharedMemory class, and then put all the shared stuff, like LockTable,
XactionTable, Buf_Mgr, etc. in the shared memory. Since each of those objects
has a global pointer in the Minirel DBMS, this class will also let those global
pointers point to corresponding  objects in the shared memory. In this way, all
users can see those objects in the shared memory concurrently and can
manipulate them directly(subject to mutual exclusion). Other groups are totally
shaded away from the details, and only see those globally available pointers
and objects.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
In Minirel, there is global pointer for an object of this class, it is<p>
<i><p>
       	(ShMemMgr*) SM_Mgr</i><p>
<p>
to get a chunk of shm, do following:<p>
<i><p>
       	SM_Mgr-&gt;malloc(size);  </i><p>
<p>
which will give away (size)bytes shared memory memory allocated ealier, and
return the beginning address of that piece of shared memory.<p>
<pre>
class ShMemMgr{
	
	ShMemMgr(int size = 20);	Default 20K bytes
	char* malloc(int size);		Overloaded malloc for shared 
					memory management
}</pre>
<p>
<p><p>
2.5  <u>Xaction_manager class</u><p>
<p>
Xaction_manager is composed by two major classes and some of other groups
defined classes. The function of Transaction is to provide other project group
a "hanger" for their own stuff and some vital information for the whole
project. The reason for this "hanger" is that we are in the multi user
environment, every user has his own stack. After finishing his own task, he
will leave. Data base itself must have a way to keep track of this kind of
activity. For groups like crash recovery and log manager, they regularly need
to know the number of current users and their status. For the whole database
system, we also need a centralized "COMMIT", "ABORT", "SLEEP" and  "WAKEUP" to
each transaction. <p>

<pre>
class Xaction_manager:public SharedRegion{
	Xaction_manager();		constructor for Xaction_manager; 
	int begin();			called by every xaction at the 
					startup time, return a  xid to the 
					calling process; 
	
	Status 	commit();		In commit time,  be called to do 
					some clean up job. It will delete 
					Xaction object from Xaction_manager. 
					It will also call other group's 
					commit method;
	
	Status 	abort();		In abort time,  will be called to do 
					some clean up job. It will delete 
					Xaction object from Xaction_manager,
					and call other groups abort  method
	Status sleep();			put the calling process to sleep at 
					xid's semaphore.
	
	Status wakeup(int xid);		awake one of the sleeping process 
					that is sleeping on xid's semaphore; 
	
	Status print();			debug function for project management 
					group to use.	
	
	Status GetRecInfo(int xxid,RecInfo &amp;recInfo);
				        "hanger" function for log group. It 
					will return a required record 
					information in Xaction object. 
	
	Status SetRecInfo(int xxid,RecInfo &amp;recInfo);
					"hanger" function for log group. It 
					will assign a new value to RecInfo 
					object reside in Xaction object.
	
	Status GetAllRecInfo(char *db_name,int &amp;num_entries,int xid[], 
					RecInfo recInfoList[]);
				    	"hanger" function for log group. It 
					will dump "all" the RecInfo object in 
					Xaction_manager to them.
	
	Status get_lock_info(trans_lock_info* &amp;lock_info);
				       "hanger" function for lock group. It 
				       will return a trans_lock_info object 
				       to caller.	
}

<CENTER><B>3. Internal Design</B></CENTER></b><p>
<p>
		<p>
3.1  <u>Semaphore Class</u><p>
<p>
A UNIX system call <i>int semget(key_t key, int nsems, int semflg) </i>will be
called, which will obtain an array (size=nsems) of semaphores(<b><A HREF = "fig1.GIF">Fig.1</A></b>).  A
specific key is used here so that it will always return the same set of
semaphores when called multiple times.  When user asks for a new Semaphore
object, an unused semaphore in the pool is granted to him.  To do necessary
book-keeping,  an array of bit-map for keeping track of the usage of  the
semaphore pool is utilized.   This array is put in a small truck of shared
memory, which is obtained by system call <i>int shmget(key_t key, size_t size,
int shmflg);</i><p>
	 <p>
To ensure each user only attach to this shared memory once, a static integer
variable sem_count is used. The first semaphore in the semaphore is reserved to
achieve mutual exclusion access of the bit-map array.  Rest Semaphores are
available for others to use. The  <i>up()</i> and <i>down() </i>public
functions are basically implemented from system call <i>int semop(int semid,
struct sembuf *sops, unsigned int nsops).</i> For details please refer to the
attached source code. The  remove()  function will set the corresponding bit in
the bit map to 1, so it can be used by others later.<p>
<p>
<p>
3.2  <u>SharedRegion Class</u><p>
<p>
	It has a  private  variable  mutex of Semaphore type, which is used to
implement the two public function lock() and unlock(). Since this class is
designed to be the parent of all other shared classes, those children classes
will have those facilities automatically by inheritance.	<p>
	<p>
<p>
3.3 <u>SharedMemory Class</u><p>
<p>
This class will only be used by ShMemMgr class to get a chunk of shared memory
from the system, other groups are totally shielded away the existence of this
class. A large chunk of shared memory is obtained by using UNIX system call int
shmget(); the beginning address is called (char*)real_shmadd. A small section
of shared memory is reserved to store head information, the rest memory is
provided to ShMemMgr class for further manipulation. The beginning address of
thiose memory is (char*)shmadd (please refer to <b><A HREF = "fig2.GIF">Fig.2</A></b>).<p>
<p>
	In the header section, we store an offset  to points to the beginning of
available shared memory. We also put two semaphores in the header section, one
is for locking the whole shared memory(to avoid the race condition when Minirel
first starts up, since only one user can initialize it), another is used by
mutual exclusion access for public function <i>char* malloc(int size)</i> . The
char* <i>malloc(int size)</i> function will always advance the free pointer to
allocate size bytes to user, reset the offset to adequate value. An alignment
mask(=7) is used here to make sure free pointer will always point to address
ending with 000 in binary. This will at most waste 7 bytes in every
<i>malloc()</i>, but turn out to be crucial to make memory allocation
correct.<p>
	<p>
	<p>
3.4 <u>ShMemMgr Class</u><p>
<p>
This class will first create a SharedMemory object, and get a chunk of shared
memory starting at address <i>(char*)shmadd</i>. It also use a small section of
this shared memory as a header, in which two structs are stored. One  struct is
<i>head_info</i> currently with two members: a <i>tag</i> to see if it's first
user of the Minirel( Since first user will acquire the lock, there is no race
condition here ), and a <i>count</i> to count how many users are using Minirel.
When count goes to 0, delete operator will remove the shared memory and
semaphore. Another struct is <i>SharedStuff</i>, which serves as a directory to
point to all the shared objects in the shared memory. This is a homogenous
struct with all members are pointers, but casted to corresponding type, so it
has member like: <i>(Xaction_manager*) xact_mgr</i>; <i>(Buf_Mgr*)
bufmgr</i>....,  each will point to the beginning of its corresponding object
in the shared memory. (Please refer to <b><A HREF = "fig3.GIF">Fig.3</A>)</b>.<p>
<p>
So when constructor of ShMemMgr is called, it will  first create a
<i>SharedMemory</i> object, then check if it's the first user, if yes, set the
tag, and call the constructors of all those shared classes and create those
objects in the shared memory. It then lets the member pointers of struct
<i>(SharedStuff*)directory</i> and their corresponding global pointers (each
object like <i>buf_mgr</i> etc. has an associated global pointer defined in the
Minirel.h file.) point to the right address. If not the first user, it simply
passes the address saved in the member pointers of struct
<i>(SharedStuff*)directory</i> to their corresponding global pointers.  In this
way, all users have pointers point to those shared objects, communication is
achieved. On the other hand, semaphore-based lock protocol is used to guarantee
mutual exclusion.<p>
<p>
The <i>(char*)malloc(int size)</i> public function will simply call the
<i>malloc()</i> function of <i>SharedMemory</i> class. Since mutual exclusion
is guaranteed in that function, there is no need to lock here now.<p>
	<p>
<p>
3.5  <u>Xaction_manager Class</u><p>
	<p>
The idea of transaction manager came to us in the middle of this project.
After the design of shared memory management and monitor finished, we found
that it would be a good idea to have a transaction manager inside the shared
memory to keep some essential information about each Xaction and provide useful
functionality to other groups like lock manager and recovery manager.<p>
<p>
The class Xaction_manager is resided in the shared memory. It is created by
the first user process upon entering data base. Xaction_manager includes a hash
table of 200 entries, a few user specified function and some system required
functions. The hash table is a static, non-expandable array of hash object's
pointer. When an object being hashed to a given slot, it will be linked by that
pointer. If there are more than one object hashed to that slot, there will be a
linked list of hashed object. Since the maximum allowed number of co-exist
transaction at any given time is no more than 100, there is not much worry
about linked list's search time.<p>
<p>
There is also a class called Xaction. It contains all the essential data and
classes needed by different project groups. At the moment of creating a Xaction
object, we create all the enclosed user specified class objects.  Xaction
object is scattered in the whole shared memory. The only link between Xaction
and Transaction_Manager is the Xaction pointer in Transaction_Manager's hash
table. Physically, the whole picture looks like a plate of spaghetti. <p>
<p>
 Freelist and hash table list: Like Grapevine's deleted list, we have
something called freelist. It is a list of deleted Xaction object. The purpose
of free list is, next time when we need to create another Xaction object, we
will reuse the memory on free list. With this method, we can speed upwhole
system's performance since we make much less system call to kernel.<b><p>
<p>
<p>
<B><CENTER>4. Testing</CENTER></B><p>
</b><p>
<p>
Testing is the most important part of operating system infrastructure. In
order to test other parts of Minirel, we need to have OS code work correcttly
at first. We wrote 4 drivers to test all the extreme cases explicitly. <p>
<p>
<p>
4.1 <u>ShmMemMgr and Semaphore test</u>:<p>
<p>
To test ShmMemMgr and Semaphore class, we created a simple linked list class
as child class of SharedRegion which will put into the shared memory. To insert
a node in the list, it will call malloc(int size) function of ShmMemMgr class.
When node is deleted, it will be put into free list to be used later. To
achieve this, we also overload the operator new and delete. All the insertion
and deletion are protected by semaphore. Then we run several processes at the
same time. Each will to insertion and deletion concurrently. We found the
communication and synchronization is indeed achieved in this simple case. This
demonstrates the correctness of all facilities. <p>
<p>
<p>
4.2 <u>Xaction_manager and related test</u>:<p>
	<p>
In our driver for Xaction_manager, we explicitly tested the following
functions of Xaction_manager:<p>
<p>
a. Test of begin(), abort() and commit(). <p>
These functions are the most fundamental function of Xaction_manager. We
repeatedly start a transaction and then delete it from Xaction_manager 's list.
The print() function proved that hash table and linked list manipulation is
correct.<p>
<p>
b. Test of class passing and assignment:<p>
Xaction_manager involves several layers inheritance. We created a inner most
object( the one inside Xaction) independently and then assign it to the same
class object through Xaction_manager method. It proved that our class passing
for other project team is successful.<p>
<p>
c. Sleep and Wakeup function:<p>
We intently put one transaction to sleep then use another transaction to wake
it up to test if sleep and wakeup work correctly. We also tested these
functions in 3 and 5 transactions case to see if the waiting queue work as we
expected.<p>
<p>
4.3.  <u>Overall System Intergration Testing:</u> <p>
<p>
Since we provide the lowest level classes and OS facilities for other groups
to use, the correctness and functionality of our code is best demonstrated when
incorporated with the code of other groups. The feed back from groups like
buffer manager, lock manager, recovery manager give us the confidence that we
have indeed achieved our original goals.<p>
	<p>
 <b><p>
<p>
<CENTER><B>5. Discussion</B></CENTER><p>
<p>
</b><p>
After a semester of hard work, we implemented operating system infrastructure
for the rest of project team 3 weeks before the due day. It gave our
co-programmer plenty of time to test their code in multi user mode. In addition
to operating system infrastructure, we also implemented Xaction_manager, a new
data base class for multi user Minirel. Although it was not on the initial
plan, we voluntarily took that part and finished on time.<p>
<p>
The challenge of our project is to deal with system level methods correctly.
Timing is another very important issue here. Like in the case of new car test,
you need to have road first. What we provided here is more like a road to
automobile than automobile itself.<p>
	<p>
Another hard point of our project is to satisfy various project team's need.
Since everyone in the Computer Science department seems very busy, it is hard
to communicate effectively. We realized later in this semester that if you
could stand on your teammate's point,  you could serve them better.<p>
<p>
In conclusion, we have successfully provided operating system infrastructure
for the development of multi-user Minirel. For inter process communication, we
have provided a SharedMemory class and ShMemMgr class. For mutual exclusion and
synchronization, we have provided a Semaphore class. In addition to these, we
have also provided a Xaction_manager class for management of active
transactions. <p>
