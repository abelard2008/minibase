<H2>Introduction</h2><p>
The Shared Memory manager is the core that is required to convert
Minibase from a single user to a multi-user system. It provides the
operating systems support that is required sharing of resources,
communication between processes and the utilities required to
achieve sychronized access to the shared resources.
<p>
The Shared Memory manager provides the following: <br>
* Semaphores: These are are the latches that are used for mutual exclusion
amongst processes.<br>
* Shared Region base class: This includes a semaphore as a private member
of its class. Classes like the Lock Table and the Log Tail are derived from
this class. A semaphore thus protects the derived structures and ensures
synchronous access to them.<br>
* Classes required to create and manipulate the shared memory. 
<p>
<h2>Class Structure and Implementation Details</h2><p>
<h4>The Semaphore class  </h4><p>
In the Minibase multi-user system, a pool of semaphores are created in
shared memory at server startup, using UNIX system calls. This class contains
an array of the available semaphores alongside some book keeping information
which keeps track of the semaphores as they are requested/released by the
system.A user ( Minibase client process ) requiring a semaphore, on
declaring a new Semaphore object, receives one from the pool that was
created at server startup. The Semaphores and shared memory code has been
currently written for SunOS, and may require a small amount of work to port
it to HP-UX or other UNIX systems.
<pre>class Semaphore{

Semaphore(int init=1, int flag = 0); 
      // constructor :  If flag == 0, a binary semaphore
      // initialized to a value given by init

void 	operator delete(void *p);    
      // To delete semaphore object. 

int 	up();
      // Unlock.

int  	down(); 		
      // lock.

void    remove();	   
      // return semaphore to the system pool.
}</pre>

<p>
<h4>The SharedRegion class </h4>  <p>
<p>
The base SharedRegion class contains a semaphore as a private member of
its class.
 If a class is derived from
 this base class, it thus contains a semaphore and can call the 'lock'
 and 'unlock' methods provided for semaphores. Each method of the derived
 class may be sandwiched between a 'lock' and an 'unlock' call. It is
 therefore appropriate for a class to be derived from the base SharedRegion
 when the methods of the derived class are naturally formed units
 of mutual exclusion. The Lock Table, BufDesc (that which defines a frame
 in the buffer pool) and Log tail classes are examples of derived classes
 of the base SharedRegion class.
<p>
<pre>
class SharedRegion {
	void 	lock(); 
	   // Enter, set semaphore
	void 	unlock(); 
	   // Exit region, unlock semaphore
};</pre>
<p>
<h4>Classes to manipulate shared memory : The SharedMemory class</h4> <p>
<p>
Minibase has a globally defined key, called the 'SHM_KEY' which ensures that
all systems connect to the same chunk of the system's shared memory.
This chunk is mapped to the process space of every Minibase client.
<p>
<pre>
class SharedMemory{
	
	SharedMemory(int size); 
	   // Size of shared memory to be created, in kilobytes 
	
	char* begin_shmadd(); 	    
	   // The beginning address of shared memory
	
	char* malloc(int size);	    
	   // Overloaded malloc.. Returns the address.
	
	void 	lock();
	void 	unlock(); 
}</pre>
<p>
<h4>Classes to manipulate shared memory : The ShMemMgr class</h4>
<p>
This class manages the shared memory. It is called only once and only
by the Minibase server. It contains a pointer to the SharedMemory class,
which is where the actual shared memory is created. 
Since a fixed amount of shared memory is pre-allocated, the 
Shared Memory manager maintains some variables which keep track of current
utilization levels in the system. A point to be noted is that there is
no mechanism to expand the size of shared memory once the server has
been started i.e. once the preallocated chunk has been allocated to the
minibase clients, the system cannot dynamically increase the amount of
shared memory.
<p>
Minibase has a global shared pointer to this class.
<p>
<pre>
class ShMemMgr{
	
	ShMemMgr(int size = 20);	// Default 20K bytes
	char* malloc(int size);		// Overloaded malloc for shared 
					// memory management
}</pre>
