<H1>Transaction Manager</H1>

<P>
The Transaction Manager maintains information about all transactions in the
system. It also provides methods using which the Lock Manager
and the Recovery Manager can obtain
information from the shared memory regions (for example, the Recovery Manager
requires information from the dirty page table during checkpointing ).
In addition, the TM manages information about the process ids of the
clients in the system. This is information required by the Minibase
server.

<H2>Design Decisions</H2>
Every process is a <i>transaction</i> in the Minibase multi-user model.
The Minibase server is transaction 0. Subsequent transactions are
assigned sequential transaction identifiers.  
Nested transactions from a single process are not possible in the
current design of the Minibase system. Nested transactions may be
modelled by transactions from different clients, that attach to
the Minibase server.
<p>
The base 
xaction_manager class includes one key data structure --- an array 
of pointers to transactions.  The transaction class is derived
from the base 
<A HREF="os.html"> SharedRegion class</A> and contains data critical
to the Lock Manager and the Recovery Manager.
<p>
The transaction maintains a linked list of lock queues. Each element in
this list points to a lock entry which holds information about the page
which the transaction has a lock on. There are thus as many entries in
the list as there are pages that the transaction has a lock on. <br>
It also maintains information about the last LSN and the minimum LSN
associated with the transaction. For more details about LSNs and their
use in recovery, refer to details about the 
<A HREF="../logMgr/logMgr.html"> Log Manager</A>.
<p>
The transaction manager also maintains some information about the clients
in the system, namely their process identifiers and a flag 
indicating the validity of a transaction. This is required by the Minibase
server for deadlock detection and resolution.
