<H1>Shared Memory Manager</H1>

<P>

The Shared Memory Manager provides two kinds of operating systems
support to Minibase: It provides the lowest levels of semaphores, which
are required to provide locking and mutual exclusion, and
a collection of methods using which shared memory 
may be instantiated and accessed.

<H2>Design Decisions</H2>
The system maintains an array of available semaphores and assigns them, as
they are requested. A Shared Memory class object
is responsible for allocating chunks
of shared memory as and when required. It also maintains some book-keeping 
information about the shared memory. A shared memory manager 
(ShMemMgr) class object keeps
track of all global pointers to the shared memory region and provides
methods to access these pointers.
<p>
A point to note when observing the <A HREF="os.h">
public interface</A> is that the SharedRegion class is the base class
from which shared data structures like the Lock table are derived.
The SharedRegion class contains a semaphore. If a class is derived from
this base class, it thus contains a semaphore and can call the <i>lock</i>
and <i>unlock</i> methods provided for semaphores. Each method of the derived
class may be sandwiched between a lock and an unlock call. It is
therefore appropriate for a class to be derived from the base SharedRegion
when the methods of the derived class are naturally formed units
of mutual exclusion.  The definitions of the 
<A HREF="../bufMgr/public.txt"> buffer manager</A> indicate 
that the BufMgr class is not a derived class of the class SharedRegion.
This is because we would like the granularity of latching to be at the
level of <i>buffer frames</i>, rather than the entire buffer pool.
