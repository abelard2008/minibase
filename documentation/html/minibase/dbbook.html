This book covers the fundamentals of modern database management
systems, in particular relational database systems.  It is intended as a
text that can be used in an introductory database course for undergraduates,
although it contains enough material to support a second course as well.
The 
<A HREF="minibase.html"><B>Minibase</B></A>
relational DBMS software has been developed in conjunction with this book,
and is intended to support a variety of hands-on course projects.
The book can be used, optionally with the accompanying software, in
two distinct kinds of courses:
<P>
(1)  A course that aims to present the
principles that underlie database systems, with a practical
focus but without any implementation assignments.
For such a course, the software can be used to create a variety 
of exercises and experiments that involve no programming.
<P>
(2)  A course that has a strong systems emphasis and assumes that students
have good programming skills in C and C++.  In this case, the software
can be used as the basis for implementation projects in which
students are asked to implement various parts of a relational DBMS.
Several central modules in the project
software (e.g., heap files, buffer manager, B+ trees, hash indexes,
various join methods, concurrency control and recovery algorithms)
are described in sufficient detail in the text to enable
students to implement them, given the (C++) class interfaces.

<B>Database Management Systems</B> is published by the
<A HREF="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/education/college.htm"><B>College Division</B></A>
of the
<A HREF="http://www.mcgraw-hill.com/index.html"> <B>McGraw-Hill Companies,</B></A>
and is available in a beta edition (ISBN 0-07-052522-6)
for Fall 96 and Spring 97.  The
first edition is expected to be available by May 1997.  The book 
and the 
software have both been class-tested at Wisconsin
for several semesters, and will be class-tested at several other
schools in Fall 96 and Spring 97.
