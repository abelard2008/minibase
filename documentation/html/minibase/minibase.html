Minibase is a database management system intended for educational use, 
and is distributed subject to conditions set forth in the
<B><A HREF="minibase.notice.html">Terms of Distribution.</A></B>
It has a parser, optimizer,
buffer pool manager, storage mechanisms (heap files, secondary
indexes based on B+ Trees and Linear
Hashing), and a disk space management system.
The goal is not just to have a functional DBMS,
but to have a DBMS where the individual components can be studied
and implemented by students.
<P>
A GUI front-end (with support for a subset of QBE),
visualization tools for the buffer manager, B+ trees, query optimizer
and database design (specifically, creating ER diagrams and doing normalization)
are available.
<P>
The multi-user version of Minibase extends the single-user version 
with logging, locking and recovery components.
<P>
Minibase has been developed in conjunction with the text
<A HREF="dbbook.html"><B>Database Management Systems</B></A>
by 
<a HREF="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~raghu/raghu.html"><B> Raghu Ramakrishnan</B>.</a> 
The HTML documentation for Minibase provides an overview of the
system architecture and component interfaces.  The text provides the 
necessary background information on file and record organizations,
buffer management, access methods, relational query languages and
operator implementation techniques, 
query optimization, database design, concurrency control and recovery.
