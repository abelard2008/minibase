For compiling and testing 1996's minibase ([The Minibase Home Page](http://research.cs.wisc.edu/coral/mini_doc/minibase.html)) code under my Fedora 24 and gcc x86_64 6.3.1, the  GUI front-end (with support for a subset of QBE), visualization tools and SQL parser(some syntax in sql.y and some header files can not be supported now) are removed, and of course some source code must be modified for the current c++ syntax. 

The buffer manager, B+ trees, space mamager have been tested successfully.
