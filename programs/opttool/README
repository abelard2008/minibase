This directory houses the optimizer visualization tool, a Tcl/Tk
program that graphically displays the inner workings of the minibase
optimizer.

The tool requires a copy of "treesh", version 3.6, to be in this same
directory.  This is the executable that wraps Tcl/Tk.  A copy of the
tree 3.6 distribution is included here.  Once you have built treesh,
you run the tool with the "minibase.tcl" script.
