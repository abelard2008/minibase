% clarification on above abbreviations :

% numberofrelations
%     number of relations in the database

% relationname
%     relation name

% numattrs
%     number of attributes for the given relation

% card
%     cardinality

% tuplesize
%     size of a tuple in bytes; equals the total of the individual
%     attribute sizes for the relation

% numpages
%     number of pages that the relation occupies

% attrname
%     attribute name

% attrid
%     an integer identifier for the attribute, unique within the relation

% type
%     type of the attribute, T for string, I for integer, R for real

% minval
%     minimum value for the attribute

% maxval
%     maximum value for the attribute

% size
%     size of the attribute in bytes

% offset
%     byte number within the tuple where the attribute's field starts

% numberOfAccessMethods
%     number of access methods; the access methods are then listed below the
%     attribute; an access method is for the attribute it is under

% methodName
%     access method name
%		**NOTE** that the type of the access method is determined
%               by the SelectType, NOT by this field.

% estimatedCost
%     estimated cost of accessing the entire relation using the given access
%     method

% order
%     attribute order that the access method presents tuples in; A ascending;
%     D descending; R random

% clus
%     clustered; 1 means the the access method is a clustered index; 0 means
%     it is a non-clustered index

% distKeys
%     number of distinct keys for the given access method (an index)

% pages
%    number of pages to reach a "leaf"

% SelectType
%     select type that the index supports; 0 for range; 1 for exact match;
%     2 for both range and exact match; 3 for undefined

% filename
%    name of the index file
