Installation instructions for designview
-------------------------------------------------

Directory structure
--------------------
	src:		Source code for the designview custom wish interpreter
	lib:		Tcl/tk code
	bin:		Executables
	doc:		Help files
	examples:	Sample designview input files


Installation
-------------
Run 'make install' from the designview root directory. This runs a make
process in the src subdirectory, and then moves an executable into the
bin subdirectory.

You will need to edit the Makefile in the src directory.  The compiler
used in development is gcc 2.7.2, thus you should probably use this
to compile the designview tcl/tk interpreter.


Running designview
---------------
designview is started by executing the designview shell script found in the
designview root directory.

To run designview from any directory, set the DBNPATH environment variable
to the designview root directory, and also put the designview root directory
into your PATH environment variable. Then typing 'designview' at a command
prompt will bring up the system.

You can also run designview without setting any environment variables by
just changing into the designview root directory and typing 'designview'.
