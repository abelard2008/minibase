The buffer manager and B-tree visualization tools use a modified
"treesh" that has been renamed "btree_wish".  This directory contains
the one file changed from tree-4.0.1, tkAppInit.c, and the one new
file that has been added.  To run the two tools, you must build
"treesh" using these two files and the libminibase.a library, and
rename it to "btree_wish".
