CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------
Many different things are defined in config_file. Make changes there,
only, if you want to customize things - do not touch the code unless
you know what you are doing (make sure you keep a copy of the old stuff)


COLORS
------
Better have 2 versions - one for colored and one for black-and-white
screens, or the problem that it is slow will get worse...(many if sta-
tements - can try it, though)


LOG-FILES
---------
Log-files are in subdirectory LOG_FILES - see config_file.


BITMAPS
-------
The bitmaps are in subdirectory BITMAPS - see config_file.


CONTENTS OF LOG FILES
---------------------
The way the contents of the log-file are interpreted is described in
the man page - you may change this (make sure you make the changes in
the man-page, too) in file trace.tcl - methods Startup and Next.

MAN PAGE
--------
Is in subdirectory manual - if you want to change this, you have to change
also file show_man_page.
