This directory contains the buffer manager visualization tool, a
Tcl/Tk program that graphically displays the inner workings of the
minibase buffer manager.

The tool requires a copy of "btree_wish", which is a modified version
of the "tree" Tcl extension library, version 3.6.2.  This is the
executable that wraps Tcl/Tk.  You must also modify the "view_bufmgr"
script to refer to the public installation directory for the tool.
