CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------
Many different things are defined in config_file. Make changes there,
only, if you want to customize things - do not touch the code unless
you know what you are doing (make sure you keep a copy of the old stuff)


COLORS
------
Better have 2 versions - one for colored and one for black-and-white
screens, or the problem that it is slow will get worse...(many if sta-
tements - can try it, though)


LOG-FILES
---------
Log-files are in subdirectory LOG_FILES - see config_file.


BITMAPS
-------
The bitmaps are in subdirectory BITMAPS - see config_file.


FILE-COLOR BLOBS AND PINS
-------------------------
If you want to change the size and/or position of the blob indicating
the file, you cannot do that from the config file - go to the source
code - method FileColor, in file frame.tcl. Same with the pin bitmap -
only it is method PinColor, this time...


CONTENTS OF LOG FILES
---------------------
The way the contents of the log-file are interpreted (which is page, 
which is the frame etc) is described in the man page - you may 
change them (make sure you make the changes in the man-page, too)
in file trace.tcl - methods Startup and Next.


MAN PAGE(S)
-----------
In subdirectory manual - if you want to change this, you have to change
file show_man_page. If you want to change the place this file is stored,
do it in procedure CreateMenu, file menu.tcl...


NUMBER OF FRAMES
----------------
NO MORE THAN 64 AND NO LESS THAN 16 FRAMES - if you want to change this 
you will have to go in the trace.tcl file - methods Set_rows, Set_Columns...


REPLACEMENT STRATEGIES SHOWN
----------------------------
By setting show_no_list to 1 no replacement strategies will be shown
You can also set show_lru_list and show_replacement_strategy_list,
appropriately - see config_file (if the strategy in the log-file is
LRU, no ther replacement strategy is shown - this cannot be changed
outside the code...


HIT-RATIO IN GRAPH
------------------
Problem with hit-ratio - see manual page.


ERRORS DETECTED (very few)
--------------------------
o Accessing a frame thinking that it has the wrong page and/or file
o Writing a clean page
o Buffer sizes greater than 64 and less than 16
o Opening an opened file
o Messing with a file that is not opened (discuss with Raghu)
o Too many open files
o Unpinning a page more times than it has been pinned
o Reading onto a dirty page

WARNINGS:
o Dirtying an already dirty page
o Pinning a dirty page
